    "content": "From wildfires in Canada to flooding in India, people across the world are dealing with the realities of climate change. The world recorded its highest temperatures ever this summer and the climate models for 2100 make sobering reading.\n\nTo tackle climate change we need a data-driven approach, using technology to help decarbonize the sectors that contribute to it. The transportation sector is the largest contributor to climate change in the US and Europe. Simply put, travel is in need of a long-overdue update. The good news is that, in 2024, we will kickstart that much needed moment for green mobility.\n\nThe International Energy Agency estimates 55 percent of the reductions needed to cut all greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 are linked to everyday consumer choices, particularly driving.\n\nOver two-thirds of consumers cite the lack of electric charging stations as the biggest barrier to buying electric vehicles (EVs). However, new legislation, such as the European Green Deal and universal EV charging standards in the US, will help to put new chargers on the road.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nThe infrastructure is growing, but the information is still catching up. That’s why, to empower drivers with the information they need, Google has updated its Search experience to make it easier to research the costs and incentives associated with EVs. Google Maps also shows nearby EV chargers and offers eco-friendly routing—providing directions optimized for fuel or battery efficiency. In 2024, drivers will not only be able to more easily purchase an electric vehicle, they will be able to more easily charge them. The theory is simple: When billions of people have the tools to make more informed decisions, meaningful change is possible.\n\nThe impact of individuals grows exponentially when coupled with systemic investments by government officials and business leaders. We all know the feeling of impatience when waiting for the light to turn green. It’s not just an inconvenience, it’s bad for the environment—US Department of Energy data suggests that eliminating idling vehicles is equivalent to taking 5 million cars off American roads. In partnership with local governments, Google (where I am the chief sustainability officer) recently expanded Project Green Light—which leverages AI to improve traffic light efficiency—to 12 cities around the world. Early results show there’s potential to reduce the number of vehicle stops by up to 30 percent, lowering emissions for up to 30 million car trips monthly.\n\nYet, we cannot focus exclusively on cars—providing sustainable public transport is also vital. Nowhere is the value clearer than in Japan, a leader in high-speed rail. One passenger traveling between Tokyo and Osaka emits 4.2 kilograms of carbon dioxide—one-twelfth the emissions of a passenger on a Tokyo-Osaka flight. That's why it's so important for people to have information on alternative, climate-friendly modes of transport at their fingertips—including comparable train routes, biking, and walking suggestions. This also illustrates the potential impact of projects like the Brightline train, designed to connect Los Angeles and Las Vegas by electric, high-speed rail.\n\nAlong with opportunities on roads and rails, in 2024 we will make progress on our skies. Aviation is responsible for 3.5 percent of global warming—35 percent of which is non-emissions related. The culprit? Contrails—the feathery white trails created by airplanes. They may look harmless, but they trap heat inside the Earth’s atmosphere. Using AI-based technology, Google partnered with American Airlines and Breakthrough Energy to reduce contrails by 54 percent—achieving the first proof point of verifiable and cost-effective contrail avoidance. Delta Airlines, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and others are also working to tackle the issue. In 2024, clean mobility will move closer to the norm across transportation, not the exception.",

    "content": "In 2024, fusion technology will finally make the transition from basic research to commercial application. The reason for that will be the construction and completion of the first commercial fusion demonstrators. These cutting-edge facilities are smaller than fusion power plants. For instance, a laser-based fusion demonstrator might use five to ten laser beams, while a commercial power plant can use several hundred. However, they have a crucial role—to prove that fusion technology works on a small scale, paving the way for the construction of larger fusion-power plants. In 2024, they will do just this, starting to build devices that will finally achieve the elusive goal of energy gain– in other words, outputting more energy than the quantity needed to kickstart the fusion process. Hitting this milestone is a critical step in addressing the steeply increasing global energy demand, as fusion energy has the potential to provide an abundant, carbon-free source of power.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nIn 2022, researchers at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) in California became the first to demonstrate experimentally that a fusion process could indeed produce a net energy gain. This experiment used high-power lasers to deposit energy in a small fuel target—a millimeter-sized capsule containing frozen deuterium and tritium—creating the conditions for fusion to occur. The lasers delivered 2.05 megajoules of energy to the target, resulting in a fusion energy production of 3.1 megajoules. This was a scientific experiment—unlike fusion demonstrators, the NIF is not designed to operate continuously like a power plant. However, as a result of this scientific breakthrough, nuclear fusion has attracted considerable research, political, and investor attention in recent months.\n\nNational fusion strategies have been developed in the US, UK, Japan, Germany, and other countries to advance research and testing of the technology. Currently, the US and the UK are leading the race: The US Department of Energy funds fusion research with an annual budget of about $1.4 billion and encourages private enterprises to accelerate commercialization. The UK similarly fosters public-private partnership by raising a fusion cluster with universities and companies combining their expertise. High-profile investors recognize the opportunity of fusion technology, with over $5 billion of private capital flowing into fusion companies in the last two years.\n\nThe initiatives are bearing fruit: Several fusion companies worldwide, including Commonwealth Fusion Systems, Helion Energy, and General Fusion have announced plans to begin constructing facilities in 2024 to demonstrate their technological approach. According to the latest report by the Fusion Industry Association, over half of all fusion companies believe that fusion energy will be delivered to the public power grid during the 2030s. In May 2023, Microsoft signed a power purchase agreement with Helion Energy, to secure a supply of fusion-generated electricity by 2028. In August 2023, Marvel Fusion (a fusion energy firm I cofounded) announced a partnership with Colorado State University worth $150 million, the largest public-private partnership to date, with the aim of building the only laser facility tailored to a commercial laser-based fusion technology and the most powerful short-pulse laser system in the world. With these advances and commitments in place, 2024 is set to show that fusion is no longer a distant dream but an achievable future of clean and sustainable energy.",

    "content": "Much like the internet did in the 1990s, AI is going to change the very definition of work. While change can be scary, if the last three years taught us anything, it can also be an opportunity to reinvent how we do things. I believe the best way to manage the changes ahead for employees and employers alike is to adopt a skills-first mindset.\n\nFor employees, this means thinking about your job as a collection of tasks instead of a job title, with the understanding that those tasks will change regularly as AI advances. By breaking down your job into tasks that AI can fully take on, tasks for which AI can improve your efficiency, and tasks that require your unique skills, you can identify the skills you should actually be investing in to stay competitive in the job you have.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nAfter all, the skills required for many jobs have changed by a staggering 25 percent since 2015, and that number is expected to reach at least 65 percent by 2030 due to the rapid development of new technologies such as AI. And it’s not just skills related to AI literacy—people skills are rising in importance. Our data shows the top skills that professionals think will become more important as AI tools become more widely used at work are problem solving, strategic thinking, and time management.\n\nAs for employers, the rise of AI only increases the importance of a skills-based approach to hiring and developing talent. People are learning AI skills at a rapid clip, with the number of AI-skilled members now nine times larger than it was in 2016. And there is a hunger to put these newly developed skills into practice: LinkedIn job posts that mention artificial intelligence or generative AI have seen 17 percent greater application growth over the past two years than job posts with no mentions of the technology. The leaders that focus on these skills when hiring (rather than just the degree someone has earned or jobs they’ve had) will unlock more potential and be more agile as the way we do work continues to change.\n\nThe same is true for developing talent. We will increasingly see employers become educators, “training to hire” into ever-changing jobs through onboardings, apprenticeships, and academies, as well as “training to promote” into ever-changing roles through upskilling and tours of duty that take employees into new functions and perhaps even new careers. This will be for hard skills related to AI, but perhaps more importantly, for people skills, too: Our data shows 92 percent of US executives believe people skills are more important than ever.\n\n2024 will start to usher in a new world of work where people skills—problem solving, empathy, and active listening to name just three—are more core to career success, and people-to-people collaboration is more core to company success. Leaders and employees need to think of AI as just one tool in the toolbox. It doesn’t replace people, it allows them to do their job more effectively, leaving them time to focus on the more valuable—and more human—parts of their jobs. For instance, a software engineer can have AI help with the more routine or repetitive coding that’s regularly required, giving them more time to innovate on new ideas. Or a recruiter can save time and focus on the more strategic parts of the hiring process—like speaking to and building relationships with candidates—by letting AI handle the creation of job postings.\n\nIn 2024, leaders will lean into this ever-evolving technology while simultaneously empowering their employees, and people will align their skill-building and continuing education with AI skills and practical people skills. The result will be a new world of work that’s more human and more fulfilling than ever before.",

    "content": "Can you imagine what a digital white ethnostate or a cyber caliphate might look like? Having spent most of my career on the inside of online extremist movements, I certainly can. The year 2024 might be the one in which neo-Nazis, jihadists, and conspiracy theorists turn their utopian visions of creating their own self-governed states into reality—not offline, but in the form of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).\n\nDAOs are digital entities that are collaboratively governed without central leadership and operate based on blockchain. They allow internet users to establish their own organizational structures, which no longer require the involvement of a third party in financial transactions and rulemaking. The World Economic Forum described DAOs as “an experiment to reimagine how we connect, collaborate and create”. However, as with all new technologies, there is also a darker side to them: They are likely to give rise to new threats emerging from decentralized extremist mobilization.\n\nToday, there are already over 10,000 DAOs, which collectively manage billions of dollars and count millions of participants. So far, DAOs have attracted a wild mix of libertarians, activists, pranksters, and hobbyists. Most DAOs I have come across in my research sound innocent and fun. Personally, my favorites include theCaféDAO, which aims “to replace Starbucks” (good luck with that!); the Doge DAO, which wants to “make the Doge meme the most recognizable piece of art in the world”; and the HairDAO, “a decentralized asset manager solving hair loss.” But some DAOs use a more radical tone. For example, the Redacted Club DAO, which is rife with alt-right codes and conspiracy myth references, claims to be a secret network with the aim of “slaying” the “evil Meta Lizard King.”\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nThe year 2024 might be one in which extremists start using DAOs strategically. Policies, legal contracts, and financial transactions that were traditionally the domain of governments, courts, and banks can be replaced with smart contracts, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and cryptocurrencies. The use of anonymous bitcoin wallets and non-transparent cryptocurrencies such as Monero is already widespread among extremists whose bank accounts have been frozen. A shift to entirely decentralized forms of self-governance is only one step away.\n\nBeyond practical reasons that encourage extremists to create their own self-governed structures, there is an ideological incentive too: their fundamental distrust in the establishment. If you believe that the deep state or the “global Jewish elites” control everything from governments and Big Tech to the global banking system, DAOs offer an appealing alternative. Conversations on far-right fringe platforms such as BitChute and Odysee reveal that there is much appetite for decentralized alternative forms of collaboration, communication, and crowdfunding.\n\nSo what happens if anti-minority groups establish their own digital worlds in which they impose their own governing mechanisms? What are the stakes if trolling armies start cooperating via DAOs to launch election interference campaigns? The activities of extremist DAOs could challenge the rule of law, pose a threat to minority groups, and disrupt institutions that are currently considered fundamental pillars of democratic systems. Another risk is that DAOs can serve as safe havens for extremist movements by enabling users to circumvent government regulation and security services monitoring activities. They might also allow extremists to find new ways to fundraise, plan, and plot radicalization campaigns or even attacks. While many governments have focused on developing legal frameworks to regulate AI, few have even recognized the existence of DAOs. Their looming exploitation for extremist and criminal purposes is something that has flown under the radar of global policymakers.\n\nTechnology expert Carl Miller, who has long warned of potential misuse of DAOs, told me that “even though DAOs behave like companies, they are not registered as legal entities.” There are only a few exceptions: The US states of Wyoming, Vermont, and Tennessee have passed laws to legally recognize DAOs. With no regulations in place to hold DAOs accountable for extremist or criminal activities, the big question for 2024 will be: How can we ensure the metaverse doesn’t give rise to digital white ethnostates or cyber caliphates?",

As the US weathers an election likely to be both divisive and often divorced from reality, social media will again be a battleground for public opinion and perception. But the platforms on which these conversations will take place will be smaller in scale, more diverse, and less connected to one another.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2016 election, Donald Trump discovered he could speak directly to an audience of tens of millions on Twitter. Thrown off the platform after the January 6 insurrection, Trump moved to the much smaller Truth Social, a network whose main selling point seemed to be his presence. Trump lost something precious when he was deplatformed: the ability to speak to the “big room”—a platform that reached a broad swath of the people interested in public affairs.\n\nBig-room spaces, like Twitter and Instagram, are continual battlegrounds for attention. They’re invaluable for activists, who want messages like #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter to reach new converts to the movement, and for influencers who build power and revenue by building audiences. But they are also inherently conflicted spaces, as people of different points of view spar over what types of speech are appropriate for the space.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing.

He’s never going to be thrown off Truth Social, because his statements, no matter how inflammatory, are the raison d’être for the network.\n\nConsciously or not, other platforms are moving in the same direction. Elon Musk’s compulsive destruction of Twitter is turning it into a smaller room, a safe space for extremists that makes it unsafe for those who don’t share their views. Reddit, long one of the most exciting spaces for informed, topical conversations, is shedding users as it implements unpopular, Muskian policies in hopes of generating much-needed revenue. Some subreddits are migrating to Discord, where their conversations won’t overlap with thousands of other topics on Reddit, but where they have full control over their chosen rules of the road.\n\nSmall-room networks can be deeply important spaces for communities to find support and solidarity. When you seek support for living with diabetes or without alcohol (two struggles I’m personally engaged in), you’re not looking for confrontation, but for camaraderie, comfort, and constructive advice. Millions of us find these spaces in subreddits, Facebook groups, or even on special-purpose social networks, such as Archive of One’s Own, which links together 5 million fan-fiction authors and fans each month.\n\nBut small rooms have a big downside: They’re as useful for Nazis as they are for knitters. These conversations, insulated from outside scrutiny, can normalize extreme points of view and lead people deeper into dark topics they expressed a passing interest in.\n\nWe need small-room networks—they introduce strangers to one another, building social capital and connection between people who might never interact in the physical world. But they further fragment the public sphere, which means the 2024 election may be even more fractious than the ones we’ve seen thus far in our social media age.",

    "content": "Many years before ChatGPT was released, my research group, the University of Cambridge Social Decision-Making Laboratory, wondered whether it was possible to have neural networks generate misinformation. To achieve this, we trained ChatGPT’s predecessor, GPT-2, on examples of popular conspiracy theories and then asked it to generate fake news for us. It gave us thousands of misleading but plausible-sounding news stories. A few examples: “Certain Vaccines Are Loaded With Dangerous Chemicals and Toxins,” and “Government Officials Have Manipulated Stock Prices to Hide Scandals.” The question was, would anyone believe these claims?\n\nWe created the first psychometric tool to test this hypothesis, which we called the Misinformation Susceptibility Test (MIST). In collaboration with YouGov, we used the AI-generated headlines to test how susceptible Americans are to AI-generated fake news. The results were concerning: 41 percent of Americans incorrectly thought the vaccine headline was true, and 46 percent thought the government was manipulating the stock market. Another recent study, published in the journal Science, showed not only that GPT-3 produces more compelling disinformation than humans, but also that people cannot reliably distinguish between human and AI-generated misinformation.\n\nMy prediction for 2024 is that AI-generated misinformation will be coming to an election near you, and you likely won’t even realize it. In fact, you may have already been exposed to some examples. In May of 2023, a viral fake story about a bombing at the Pentagon was accompanied by an AI-generated image which showed a big cloud of smoke. This caused public uproar and even a dip in the stock market. Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis used fake images of Donald Trump hugging Anthony Fauci as part of his political campaign. By mixing real and AI-generated images, politicians can blur the lines between fact and fiction, and use AI to boost their political attacks.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nBefore the explosion of generative AI, cyber-propaganda firms around the world needed to write misleading messages themselves, and employ human troll factories to target people at-scale. With the assistance of AI, the process of generating misleading news headlines can be automated and weaponized with minimal human intervention. For example, micro-targeting—the practice of targeting people with messages based on digital trace data, such as their Facebook likes—was already a concern in past elections, despite its main obstacle being the need to generate hundreds of variants of the same message to see what works on a given group of people. What was once labor-intensive and expensive is now cheap and readily available with no barrier to entry. AI has effectively democratized the creation of disinformation: Anyone with access to a chatbot can now seed the model on a particular topic, whether it’s immigration, gun control, climate change, or LGBTQ+ issues, and generate dozens of highly convincing fake news stories in minutes. In fact, hundreds of AI-generated news sites are already popping up, propagating false stories and videos.\n\nTo test the impact of such AI-generated disinformation on people’s political preferences, researchers from the University of Amsterdam created a deepfake video of a politician offending his religious voter base. For example, in the video the politician joked: “As Christ would say, don’t crucify me for it.” The researchers found that religious Christian voters who watched the deepfake video had more negative attitudes toward the politician than those in the control group.\n\nIt is one thing to dupe people with AI-generated disinformation in experiments. It’s another to experiment with our democracy. In 2024, we will see more deepfakes, voice cloning, identity manipulation, and AI-produced fake news. Governments will seriously limit—if not ban—the use of AI in political campaigns. Because if they don’t, AI will undermine democratic elections.",

    "content": "A recent global study, which surveyed 10,000 young people from 10 countries, showed that nearly 60 percent of them were extremely worried about the future state of the planet. The report, which was published in the medical journal The Lancet, also showed that nearly half of the respondents said that such distress affected them daily, and three-quarters agreed with the statement that “the future is frightening.” This, and many other studies, show clearly that climate change is not just a threat to the environment that we inhabit. It also poses a very real threat to our emotional well-being.\n\nPsychologists have categorized these feelings of grief, distress, and worry about the current climate emergency—a common occurrence among youth today—under the label of “eco-anxiety.” According to the Climate Psychology Alliance, eco-anxiety is defined as the “heightened emotional, mental or somatic distress in response to dangerous changes in the climate system.” Eco-anxiety doesn’t just affect young people. It also affects researchers who work in climate and ecological science, burdened by the reality depicted by their findings, and it affects the most economically marginalized across the globe, who disproportionately bear the devastating impacts of climate breakdown.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nIn 2024, eco-anxiety will rise to become one of the leading causes of mental health problems. The reasons are obvious. Scientists estimate that the world is likely to breach safe levels of temperature rise above pre-industrial levels for the first time by 2027. In recent years, we’ve seen wildfires tear through Canada and Greece, and summer floods decimate regions in Pakistan that are home to nearly 33 million people. Studies have shown that those impacted by air pollution and rising temperatures are more likely to experience psychological distress.\n\nTo make matters worse, in the face of climate catastrophe, our political class is not offering strong leadership. The COP28 conference in Dubai will be headed by an oil and gas company executive. In the UK, the government is backtracking on its green commitments.\n\nFortunately, greater levels of eco-anxiety will also offer an avenue for tackling the climate crisis head-on. Caroline Hickman, a researcher on eco-anxiety from the University of Bath, cautions that the feelings of worry, grief, despair, and despondency associated with eco-anxiety should not be pathologized. After all, the cause of this mental distress is undeniably external. According to Hickman, anyone experiencing these emotions is displaying entirely natural and rational reactions to the climate crisis. Her suggestion? Harness eco-anxiety as a tool for good—as an emotion that can galvanize people to act in protection of our planet.\n\nThis is why, in 2024, we will also see more people around the world join the fight for climate justice and seek jobs that prioritize environmental sustainability. Campaigners will put increased pressure on fossil fuel industries and the governments that subsidize them to rapidly phase out the usage of polluting coal, oil, and gas. It’s now clear that not only are they the main culprits for the climate crisis, they are also responsible for the mental health crisis that is starting to affect most of us. Eco-anxiety is not something we will defeat with therapy—we will tackle it by taking action.",

    "content": "In 2024, there will be a paradigm shift in employee-employer power and trust dynamics. It’s part of a generational redesign of work from being like a game of Tetris to becoming like a game of Roblox.\n\nGrowing up, I spent countless hours playing Tetris on my Nintendo Game Boy. There was something mesmerizing about slotting the flat-sided blocks together that fell from above. The design of the game was clean, precise, and simple. It gave the player a sense of order and control. I showed my 12-year-old son Tetris and asked if he wanted to play. “Why would I?” he quickly replied. “You can never beat the system.” And, in this sense, he’s right.\n\nOrganizations by design used to be a lot like a game of Tetris—top-down, hierarchal, with clear rules. Work had fixed boundaries around hours, physical locations, and roles. Importantly, these boundaries were mostly set by the employer, not the employee.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nWhile I’m part of Generation Tetris (or Gen X), my son is very much a member of Generation Roblox (Gen Z). In his world, just like in the game of Roblox, there are endless possibilities of realms you can create and roles you can play. You can invent your dream job, build bridges or spaceships, take care of a farm, or live in a mansion on the waterfront. At its heart, Roblox is about self-authorship. But the feeling of control comes from being a creator, not organizing blocks. He loves Roblox because, in his words, “It’s my world and my rules.”\n\nThe world of Tetris and the world of Roblox are in many ways a powerful metaphor for a profound power and trust shift happening in the world of work. Gen Z (and Y and Alpha that will start to enter the workforce at the end of this decade) have little interest in a way of working designed like a game of Tetris. The rules, rewards, and reporting structures don't make any sense to them. Given that, by 2025, 27 percent of the workforce in OECD countries will be Gen Z, it’s a pressing problem to fix. By 2030, the Roblox generation will be the majority, with over 58 percent of the workforce made up of Gen Z and millennials.\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, almost two-thirds of Gen Z would prefer to work for themselves or a startup. 80 percent of Gen Z workers globally are looking to find a job that better aligns with their values. About half report they would quit their job if it interfered with their work-life balance. The solution proposed to these changing work dynamics is often flexibility. Yes, younger generations want or expect more flexibility, but focusing on where and when people work is missing a deeper paradigm shift—people’s relationship to organizations has been transformed.\n\nIn many ways, the design of Tetris reflected a “power over” way of thinking about leadership: “If I tell others what to do, they will follow.” You don’t get to invent rules and boundaries; they’re inherent in a linear, top-down system. Roblox, on the other hand, represents a “power with” dynamic. There are no corporate ladders to climb or hierarchies to navigate—unless you invent them. Engagement comes from the game design being collaborative, autonomous, personalized, and peer-driven.\n\nAccording to a recent report by Gartner, employee engagement has 3.8 times as much influence on employee stress as work location. In other words, how people experience their everyday work—their feelings of involvement and enthusiasm—matters more in reducing stress than where they are doing their work. Gaming designers understand this, but most organizations don’t. In 2024, leaders will have no alternative but to accept that you can no longer play Tetris in a Roblox world.\n\nWIRED has teamed up with Jobbio to create WIRED Hired, a dedicated career marketplace for WIRED readers.

    "content": "In 2024, the maternal mortality rate (MMR) in the United States and the United Kingdom will grow, although postmortem reviews conclude that 80 percent of maternal deaths in high-income countries are preventable. Rates in high-income countries across Western Europe and Asia did decrease between 1990 and 2010, yet in some of these countries, like the UK, MMRs have risen over the past decade. The US MMR has been an outlier throughout, almost doubling in the first decades of the 21st century.\n\nReasons to support the prediction that MMRs will go up include the continuing consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, MMR increases in the US and UK predated Covid, suggesting the pandemic exacerbated deeper problems.\n\nNeglect and systematic bias in medical care systems is one of them. In the US, critical challenges to improvement include the lack of universal health insurance and the increasingly competitive health care system: The US has hemorrhaged maternity care providers to the point that 36 percent of US counties, mostly rural, have none. In the UK, health care is theoretically available to all, yet the NHS has suffered insufficient investment in its facilities and equipment. Half of NHS Maternity Units are now judged substandard; shortages of midwives have hit crisis proportions. Obstetricians and midwives in both countries are suffering burnout and choosing to strike, practice abroad, retire, or change profession.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nRacial and class inequity is entrenched. The highest MMRs and largest increases are in minoritized, working class, or deprived populations. Devastating as inadequate health care systems are for these groups, the fundamental causes of their health inequities are adverse living conditions, including the stigma and discrimination they face. Robust scientific evidence that the multiple systemic assaults with which they must contend in their daily round—material hardship, environmental toxicity, decaying municipal infrastructure, and structurally rooted psychosocial stressors—chronically activate their human physiological stress response.\n\nCombined, the stressors and the tenacious coping they entail cumulatively damage health down to the cellular level, in effect accelerating biological aging. Such erosion, called “weathering,” leaves the marginalized, maligned, or exploited to suffer multiple infectious and chronic diseases, functional limitations, and even death, long before they are chronologically old. In populations subject to the most severe weathering, the increasing trend of having children at older ages increases the risk of adverse maternal and infant outcomes. Maternal mortality is a barometer of weathering’s contribution to excess deaths, as the physical stress of pregnancy is harder to withstand for a weathered body, while other manifestations of weathering often become life-threatening only after the reproductive ages.\n\nIn 2024, weathering will keep being fueled by racism, classism, xenophobia, political polarization, resentment, white nationalism, and austerity budgeting. Brexit, one outgrowth of this resentment, now exacerbates UK labor shortages, supply-chain bottlenecks, inflation, and a reduced gross domestic product. Neither the US nor Western Europe fully embrace their minority or immigrant populations.\n\nIn 2024, this problem will intensify as wars and climate change increase the flow of immigrants of color. Despite the facts, the official stance of the UK Equalities Minister is dismissive of systemic racism as a cause of health inequality. The 2021 Report by the UK Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities turns to an unsubstantiated victim-blaming shibboleth, inferring that inequity stems from the failure of minoritized populations to exercise agency and take advantage of apparently abundant health-promoting opportunities. In the politically polarized US, active and influential populist movements seek to whitewash American history.\n\nIn 2024, countermovements to take racist and classist history seriously will continue to run up against strong undercurrents of political scapegoating and zero-sum thinking throughout both countries, increasing the severity and reach of weathering.",

    "content": "The platform is the canonical form of internet business: a two-sided market that facilitates connections between end-users and business customers. Uber connects drivers with riders; Amazon and eBay connect sellers with buyers; TikTok and YouTube connect performers with audiences; social media connects people with something to say with people who want to hear it.\n\nAnd yet, lax competition law has allowed companies to consolidate, cornering their markets. Consolidated sectors, meanwhile, find it easy to sing with one voice, blocking the passage of unfavorable regulation (there's still no US national privacy law) or its enforcement (the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation shows that Ireland is even more valuable as a lawless regulation haven than it ever was as a mere tax haven).\n\nUndisciplined by competition or regulation, platforms are free to slide into “enshittification,” in which the company extracts value from both sides of the two-sided market, relying on lock-in to keep users and business customers from defecting to a rival. The year 2023 was when the platforms soured: Twitch, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Google Search, and Discord all spiraled into terminal enshittification, transferring value from users to shareholders, leaving behind shambling half-dead things that were disagreeable, but un-quittable.\n\nThe secret to that un-quittability is high “switching costs”—the economists’ term for the things you have to give up to leave a service. You hate Facebook, but you love connecting with your communities, friends, and customers. They’re holding you hostage on Facebook’s behalf—and you’re holding them hostage, too. Facebook literally banks on these high switching costs: The US Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust case against Facebook revealed internal memos in which a product manager explicitly sets out to design features that “make switching costs very high for users” in order to make it “very tough for a user to switch” to a rival service.\n\nRegulators are increasingly alive to the fact that Big Tech deliberately designs its products to impose high costs on users who have the temerity to prefer their competitors. If a company fails to offer official means for users to take their data with them, or to continue to communicate with the contacts they leave behind when they change platforms, those users have little recourse. The once-common practice of reverse-engineering a rival platform to make an unofficial, interoperable bridge—say, a tool that scrapes your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other messages for a common inbox on a new, privacy-respecting service—have been effectively outlawed by anti-circumvention laws, patents, copyrights, and exotic contract theories like “tortious interference.”\n\nDespite these barriers to exit that keep users tethered to bad platforms, most of the regulatory response to Big Tech has been aimed at making it better, rather than making it easier to leave. We keep making rules obliging Big Tech to police disinformation, harassment, and a host of other evils, but with the passage of the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), we’re finally focusing on making Big Tech less important to its users, and thus less sticky.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nThe DMA lets the commission draft per-service rules to facilitate “interoperability”—connectivity—with new services. This isn’t mere data portability, or downloading a blob containing all the messages you've sent and the photos you uploaded. It’s the ability to leave a service, set up elsewhere, and resume the conversations and transactions you left behind. For example, under the DMA, it should be possible to leave Facebook and set up on a community-run Mastodon server, and continue to participate in group discussions and exchange individual messages with the people who aren’t ready to leave (yet).\n\nIn the UK, the long-overdue Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill finally gives enforcement powers to the Digital Markets Unit at the Competition and Markets Authority, which has dozens of smart engineers and policy people on HMG’s payroll, all champing at the bit to turn their detailed market studies into policy. If the bill passes, they'll have broad latitude to fashion remedies for each dominant service, including interoperability mandates obliging walled gardens to install gateways for new market entrants, making it easy for users to leave without isolating themselves from important social relationships.\n\nIn the US, multiple interoperability bills with broad bipartisan support have made it out of committee, only to be denied a vote after intense lobbying by the tech sector. But if the UK and EU impose interoperability on tech firms, it won’t matter whether America’s captured legislature can't manage to add its own—users all over the world will get the benefits of interop and its incineration of switching costs.\n\nThese remedies will start to come online in 2024. I believe we will see one or more of the Big Tech platforms facing a legal requirement to facilitate their users’ departure: “Mr. Zuckerberg, tear down that wall(ed garden).”",

    "content": "Every November, the Global Carbon Project publishes the year’s global CO 2 emissions. It’s never good news. At a time when the world needs to be reducing emissions, the numbers continue to climb. However, while emissions have been moving in the wrong direction, many of the underpinning economic forces that drive them have been going the right way. This could well be the year when these various forces push hard enough to finally tip the balance.\n\nIn 2022, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said it expected global energy emissions to hit their peak by 2025. This estimate marked a big change from the year before, sparked by accelerated investments in low-carbon technologies following the war in Ukraine. Rystad Energy—another research and analysis group—also expects a peak by 2025. Ember Climate—the leading source on global electricity data—estimates that emissions from global electricity already peaked in 2022. Analysts might disagree on the exact date, but it’s clear that a peak in emissions is now well within our grasp.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nThe world is already steadily decarbonizing its electricity. Solar and wind are growing quickly, and in 2024 these two sources of renewable energy could outstrip the increase in electricity demand. If this happens, coal- and gas-burning will go down, and so will emissions.\n\nUnsurprisingly, when we actually reach peak emissions will depend a lot on the world’s largest emitter, China. In 2023 its emissions were still rising. This is partly due to its continued recovery from Covid-19. An ongoing drought also means its hydropower output has dropped. These factors highlight, again, how difficult these things are to predict: One unexpected event can always flip a peak into another record-breaking year.\n\nChina’s peak, however, is going to come soon, because of record-high deployments of solar and wind, and an increase in nuclear power. Soon, the country will be adding enough sustainable energy to cover its growing electricity demand. China’s solar and wind output is already enough to cover the total electricity use of some of the world’s largest economies like Canada, Brazil, Russia, Japan, and even the world’s most populous country, India. In 2023 alone it could add enough to cover the UK’s entire electricity use.\n\nAnother reason why the peak in global emissions might arrive in 2024 is the electric car revolution. Global sales of petrol and diesel cars peaked half a decade ago, and the IEA estimated that almost one in five cars sold globally in 2023 were electric. Previously, the agency hadn’t expected this milestone to be reached until 2030. (In 2020, this figure was just 4 percent.) This move to EVs will start to eat into global oil demand, until its peak arrives too. According to a report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, this could be as early as 2027.\n\nOf course, peaking emissions is just the start. The world needs to then reduce emissions, and quickly. But the downslope will be easier than the turning point, as the energy transition will no longer be in its infancy. 2024 will hopefully mark the beginning of a mature low-carbon global economy.",

    "content": "Earlier this year, Parkinson’s disease (PD) research entered a new era when the Michael J. Fox Foundation announced a momentous scientific breakthrough—the discovery of a biomarker for PD. It meant that, for the first time ever, we can now pinpoint the earliest known signs of the disease in Parkinson’s patients.\n\nThis long-awaited new procedure is called the “alpha-synuclein seeding amplification assay” (SAA), and it’s capable of detecting the misfolded alpha-synuclein in spinal fluid—the wayward protein clearly linked to Parkinson’s. It separates, with a stunning 90 percent specificity, those who have evidence of PD pathology in their cells from those who do not. It does so even before the emergence of symptoms, much like the way high blood pressure or cholesterol levels are used to detect cardiovascular risk long before a heart attack lands someone in the ER.\n\nIt would be hard to overstate the implications of this development for people living with dysfunction in their alpha-synuclein. For one thing, we’ve never had a way to know who these people are—that is, until the moment of diagnosis, by which point ongoing damage to brain cells is already well underway. As for the diagnosis itself, which for most people comes as a bolt from the blue, it has always been frustratingly subjective and essentially based on a physician’s opinion following a brief once-over in the doctor’s office—not very useful for medical care provision, let alone biomedical drug development.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nThe new SAA test is already being integrated into drug trials as the first measure that can objectively identify people with the biology we’re targeting—offering drugmakers increased assurance that they are testing experimental treatments in the right populations. For biopharma firms weighing a decision to enter or stay in the high-risk neurological disease space, this changes the value proposition of investment on its face. In 2024, we will see a ramp-up of potential new drugs entering the pipeline and progressing along their path toward pharmacy shelves.\n\nWhat’s just as remarkable is how the SAA breakthrough was arrived at. The search for the biomarker required finding and studying “needles in a haystack”: people without any traditional symptoms of PD and unwittingly living with increased risk for the disease. It was critical to figure out what biology set them apart from those who don’t get Parkinson’s. But how do you find someone who doesn’t know they’re being looked for?\n\nAs it turns out, your sense of smell is a surprisingly good predictor of brain disease. (We’re talking here not about the short-term smell loss associated with Covid-19, but significant and enduring smell loss that persists over years.) For a while now, researchers have known about the link between smell loss and neurodegeneration, especially in the presence of certain other risk factors, such as a diagnosis with REM behavior disorder (RBD), a sleep disorder. Research shows that half of those over age 60 are living with some degree of smell loss, yet the majority don’t realize it until they’re tested. If you couple this with the fact that all major brain diseases—Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, ALS, Huntington’s—are associated with some amount of smell loss, this is astounding.\n\nThe Michael J. Fox Foundation’s large-scale observational study of Parkinson’s set out to use poor smell as one of its criteria for finding and enrolling at-risk individuals. (We should note that, for this risk group, it’s still unclear if or when the disease may eventually show up.) The highly sophisticated screening device used? A humble scratch-and-sniff test, albeit the scientifically validated variety.\n\nUntil the SAA biomarker was validated, a reduced sense of smell couldn’t be objectively linked to the presence of underlying Parkinson’s disease biology. But now we can report that the test accurately diagnosed disease in 99 percent of people with poor smell and so-called sporadic Parkinson’s (in other words, those with no genetic mutation).\n\nIn 2024, we will begin to see a sea change in the possibilities around screening for and predicting PD and, very possibly, other diseases of aging. An annual scratch-and-sniff test may soon become as commonplace as your mammogram or colonoscopy. In 2024, with widespread adoption, this simple, cheap, and accessible mechanism will radically alter the landscape of what’s possible in Parkinson’s research and care.",

I will hold my phone’s camera up to it wearily. Sometimes it will work, but the font on the menu or the information will be small. I’ll have to enlarge it and take my glasses off to read it, because I’ve reached that age. Sometimes it won’t work at all. Sometimes the information on it will be out of date.\n\nIn all cases, many people—some elderly, others with access needs, children, anyone who just doesn’t fancy constantly looking at their phone—will be pushed toward more useless screen time and away from the kind of brief, friendly interactions with other humans that help us all feel part of the fabric of life. We’ll have reached the point of overdigitization.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nIt's not that there aren’t more gains to be made in technology. Incredible things are happening in biotech, especially since the pandemic. The world of continuous glucose monitors and lateral flow tests (LFT) will keep growing. In 2024 we will see new kinds of LFTs that test for other infections and problems. We will see more useful work in truly personalized medicine. But in the UK, at least, the benefit of those innovations will be increasingly available only for those who can pay for it themselves. The division between the technological haves and have-nots will only continue to grow.\n\nAnd although technology will continue to flourish, my guess is that the truly big gains in digital communication have now been made for a generation. If there’s innovation to come in digital communication it will be in the field of overdigitization, using screens where paper and actual words from real people both work better. We could—and should—use this next decade to shore up the gains we’ve made for all members of society. But I predict that, in 2024, we won’t. The Good Things Foundation estimates that 10 million people in the UK lack the basic digital skills needed to access the modern world. And 6.9 million people will continue to be excluded if they’re not given proactive help. But the current British government doesn’t seem much interested in raising the floor for the worst off.\n\nThese things can’t be done by individual companies, which come up with good-sounding ideas like, “why don’t we let people order a coffee while they’re getting their hair done, using a QR code!” It’s exactly the kind of things that incorrigibly urban WIRED readers like me think would be fun to use—but companies don’t tend to think about how to help people who aren’t going to spend money with them, or who are too put off by over-exuberant digital-everywhere to actually go into the shop.\n\nCompanies can look after their employees. And they can work to overcome that other half of the overdigitization problem: that many jobs are becoming more boring and isolated because they involve the equivalents of more pointing-at-QR-code-roundels and less actual interaction with people. But while companies can think about employees and about good customer service, thinking about improving equality and fairness is the job of government, not businesses.\n\nThere is of course one thing I can predict with total certainty for the UK in 2024: That the British public will get to have their own say on digital inequality and a whole host of other issues. Because, in 2024, Parliament will be dissolved in advance of an election.",

    "content": "“It might be the best time for any kind of business in any industry to raise money for all of history, like since the time of the ancient Egyptians,” an excitable Stuart Butterfield, CEO of Slack, told Farhad Manjoo in The New York Times in 2015.\n\nThis was no exaggeration. While interest rates remained close to zero, venture capital funds raised more money than ever and exited their investments at some of the highest valuations ever witnessed.\n\nThe glory days of VC are over, and if history is any guide, the tech bust should last through 2024 and beyond. In other words, the venture capital bust has only just started.\n\nUltralow interest rates benefited venture capital in a number of ways. Low yields on conventional investments lured investors to Silicon Valley, which promised outsized returns. Between 2016 and 2021, US venture capital investment tripled. Ultralow rates compress the dimension of time, making the future appear closer than it is. It's not surprising, therefore, that a large number of wildly extravagant startups got financed—luxury space travel, flying taxis, autonomous vehicles, and so forth. Due diligence took a back seat. Sam Bankman-Fried’s failed crypto-exchange, FTX, attracted a roster of blue-chip investors, led by Silicon Valley luminary Sequoia Capital.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nThe valuations of startups, whose profits lay in the distant future, were vastly inflated by easy money. After battery developer QuantumScape merged with a SPAC in 2020, its market cap exceeded General Motors’—even though the company expected no sales for many years. Easy money also fueled market liquidity, helping venture capitalists exit their investments. Never before were so many unprofitable companies floated at such high valuations. In 2021, more than a thousand IPOs came to the US markets, more than double the previous record.\n\nThe punch bowl was removed from the VC party after the Fed started to raise interest rates in 2022. QuantumScape’s stock is down more than 90 percent—but at least, unlike many other startups, it’s still in business. Bankman-Fried is in jail, awaiting trial. The IPO market has dried up. New entrants into the VC world have run for the hills. Others face large capital calls from VC funds they committed to during good times. Starved of fresh funds, many startups face a bleak future. WeWork, which grandly describes itself as an “office solutions company” (sounds better than “rentals”) and once sported a valuation of close to $50 billion, is the latest to hit the skids.\n\nThe Nasdaq index of technology stocks rebounded strongly in the first half of 2023. There’s huge excitement around artificial intelligence—NVIDIA, whose graphic processing units are used for AI, is valued at more than a trillion dollars. Great speculative bubbles, however, take years to unwind. Bear market rebounds, otherwise known as “sucker’s rallies,” are commonplace. After the dotcom bust, it took the Nasdaq a year and a half to trough (and more than 15 years to regain its peak). The IPO market saw little action for years.\n\nThe bear market in tech stocks is likely to return in 2024, with the Nasdaq index set to hit a new multiyear low. More startups will go bust, and venture capital funds will continue to post negative returns. As for Nvidia, it’s worth recalling what happened to Cisco Systems. During the dotcom bubble, Cisco, whose servers powered the internet, was briefly the world’s most valuable company. Its stock traded at nearly 40 times sales before crashing. More than two decades later, Cisco’s share price remains well below the bubble peak. Valued at around 35 times sales, Nvidia could well suffer a similar fate.",

    "content": "In 2024, we will see courts and regulators around the world demonstrate that tech exceptionalism, when it comes to the applicability of legal rules, is magical thinking. The tide has already started to turn on the assumption that law and regulation cannot keep up with technological innovation. But, in 2024, the sea change will come: not through new rules, but by old rules being applied aggressively to new problems.\n\nIn the United States, in the absence of federal privacy legislation, regulators have already started to repurpose laws and rules they do have at their disposal to address some of the most egregious examples of Big Tech playing fast and loose with our rights and personal data. In 2023, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) continued to expand the regulatory heft of consumer protection regulations.\n\nIt took on the problem of dark patterns—deceptive design used by apps and websites to trick users into doing something that they didn’t intend to, like buying or subscribing to something—with a half-billion-dollar fine against Fortnite maker Epic Games. The FTC also issued massive fines to Amazon for significant breaches of privacy through Alexa and Ring doorbell devices. There are no signs that, in 2024, the FTC will slow down, with rules in the pipeline to govern commercial surveillance and digital security. In 2024, we’ll see regulators in other fields and other parts of the world follow suit, bolstered by the FTC’s successes.\n\nIn 2022, the French Data Protection Authority, the CNIL, fined Clearview AI a record €20 million (around $21.9 million) for failure to comply with an earlier 2021 ruling, which had ordered the company to stop collecting and using data of persons on French territory. Further overdue penalties will be racking up in the millions of euros in 2023. In 2024, we will see regulators such as the CNIL taking more radical legal steps to show that no company is above the law.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nOpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, started 2023 with a call for global AI regulation, but balked at the actual prospect of EU regulation in the shape of the EU AI Act. While AI doomers asked for a pause on innovation to allow regulation to catch up, regulators including the Italian DPA found ways to clip their wings by stopping ChatGPT on their territory, albeit temporarily, with existing regulations. Ongoing intellectual property lawsuits, such as the one against Microsoft which charges the company to have illegally used code created by others, may well result in a turbulent 2024 for the fundamental business model of generative AI.\n\nIt is not only the individual impacts of technology that courts and regulators have in their sights. In 2024, they will also be considering the impacts on society, markets, and businesses. For instance, antitrust actions in the US and the EU launched in 2023 call into question Google’s dominance in the ad tech market, potentially shaking the monolithic logic of the programmatic advertising model that has helped create the internet as we know it today.\n\nIn 2024, we will see the regulatory void long enjoyed by Big Tech come to an end. While new laws and regulations like the AI Act, the Digital Services Act, and the Digital Markets Act in the EU start to take shape, courts and regulators will continue to apply existing law and regulation to the new ways that technology affects our daily lives. We will see the full panoply of legal tools coming to meet the challenges. Human rights and civil liberties law, competition law, consumer rights law, intellectual property, defamation, tort, employment law, and a plethora of other fields will be engaged to tackle the real-life harms already being caused by existing technology, including AI.",

    "content": "The ocean is Earth’s defining feature. Two of the most famous photographs of all time stamped that indelibly on our minds: Earthrise (1968) and The Blue Marble (1972), both taken during the Apollo missions to the moon. Once you have seen our fragile blue planet hanging in space, you can’t unsee it.\n\nThe ocean is an engine driven by sunlight, one that shifts and swirls as it carries energy, nutrients, and life around the planet in intricate patterns both large and small. The way it turns affects all our lives. It’s not a coincidence that Iceland happens to have rich fishing grounds, or that Britain is randomly warmer than Canada at the same latitude, or that luck of the draw means that the North Sea is green rather than blue.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nThese are all direct consequences of the way the ocean engine turns. Until now, the submerged workings of this giant machine have been hard to see and appreciate. In 2024, that will change.\n\nFor instance, the EU is currently building the first dynamic and interactive digital model of the entire ocean—a digital twin—which integrates knowledge from all branches of oceanography, including data from buoys, autonomous marine craft, satellites, and high-performance computational models. In 2024, this digital twin of the ocean will become operational. This will be publicly available to policymakers, businesses, and the public to help prioritize funds, make conservation decisions, and decide on how and where to deploy new marine infrastructure. The complex interactions of the ocean will become accessible in an entirely new way.\n\nOur attitude toward the ocean will also change. Historically, we’ve used it both as a universal rubbish dump (a place where we can supposedly discharge things without consequence) and as a universal resource (somewhere that is endlessly exploitable). Now that the damage this has done to the ocean is clear, we are starting to see ourselves as stewards of this engine and its life, both because it’s valuable and because we absolutely depend on it.\n\nIn 2024, a UN Global Plastics Treaty will be agreed upon, which will include a road map for controlling plastic use and waste, and a framework for reducing the plastic pollution that ends up in the ocean. Also in 2024, the second stage of an EU Action Plan for the oceans will kick in, forcing a change in rules for bottom fishing and fishing gear to specifically protect species such as common skate, guitarfish, great white shark, sturgeons, and turtles.\n\nMost importantly, our perception of ourselves will once again change. In 2024, the Artemis 2 mission will be the first crewed mission to return to the moon since 1972, taking humans around it, but not landing. For the first time since the Blue Marble photograph was taken, human eyes will once again be far enough away to see our blue planet in all its glory against the emptiness of space. And this time, when the photos are shared with the world, we will be able to see who we really are: citizens of a planet whose beating heart is its ocean.",

    "content": "In the decades to come, 2023 may be remembered as the year of generative AI hype, where ChatGPT became arguably the fastest-spreading new technology in human history and expectations of AI-powered riches became commonplace. The year 2024 will be the time for recalibrating expectations.\n\nOf course, generative AI is an impressive technology, and it provides tremendous opportunities for improving productivity in a number of tasks. But because the hype has gone so far ahead of reality, the setbacks of the technology in 2024 will be more memorable.\n\nMore and more evidence will emerge that generative AI and large language models provide false information and are prone to hallucination—where an AI simply makes stuff up, and gets it wrong. Hopes of a quick fix to the hallucination problem via supervised learning, where these models are taught to stay away from questionable sources or statements, will prove optimistic at best. Because the architecture of these models is based on predicting the next word or words in a sequence, it will prove exceedingly difficult to have the predictions be anchored to known truths.\n\nAnticipation that there will be exponential improvements in productivity across the economy, or the much-vaunted first steps towards “artificial general intelligence”, or AGI, will fare no better. The tune on productivity improvements will shift to blaming failures on faulty implementation of generative AI by businesses. We may start moving towards the (much more meaningful) conclusion that one needs to know which human tasks can be augmented by these models, and what types of additional training workers need to make this a reality.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nSome people will start recognizing that it was always a pipe dream to reach anything resembling complex human cognition on the basis of predicting words. Others will say that intelligence is just around the corner. Many more, I fear, will continue to talk of the “existential risks” of AI, missing what is going wrong, as well as the much more mundane (and consequential) risks that its uncontrolled rollout is posing for jobs, inequality, and democracy.\n\nWe will witness these costs more clearly in 2024. Generative AI will have been adopted by many companies, but it will prove to be just “so-so automation” of the type that displaces workers but fails to deliver huge productivity improvements.\n\nThe biggest use of ChatGPT and other large language models will be in social media and online search. Platforms will continue to monetize the information they collect via individualized digital ads, while competition for user attention will intensify. The amount of manipulation and misinformation online will grow. Generative AI will then increase the amount of time people spend using screens (and the inevitable mental health problems associated with it).\n\nThere will be more AI startups, and the open source model will gain some traction, but this will not be enough to halt the emergence of a duopoly in the industry, with Google and Microsoft/OpenAI dominating the field with their gargantuan models. Many more companies will be compelled to rely on these foundation models to develop their own apps. And because these models will continue to disappoint due to false information and hallucinations, many of these apps will also disappoint.\n\nCalls for antitrust and regulation will intensify. Antitrust action will go nowhere, because neither the courts nor policymakers will have the courage to attempt to break up the largest tech companies. There will be more stirrings in the regulation space. Nevertheless, meaningful regulation will not arrive in 2024, for the simple reason that the US government has fallen so far behind the technology that it needs some time to catch up—a shortcoming that will become more apparent in 2024, intensifying discussions around new laws and regulations, and even becoming more bipartisan.",

    "content": "Until now, AI systems have been largely designed to be algorithm-based and focused on input and output. But there is a conversation going on in both the digital technology and education sectors about the positive value of multidisciplinary design, and the importance of outcomes beyond revenue maximization and scaled efficiency.\n\nIn 2024, creativity will drive innovation in AI. Until now AI has curated things, but the release of new generative tools offers enormous opportunities for creators. Guided by creative technologists and leaders on both sides of the creative-tech divide, AI in 2024 will be thoughtful, more inclusive, and impact-led. Contrary to the belief that AI systems stifle creativity, this will catalyze inventiveness in corporations and academia. Here's what we can expect:\n\nThe Renaissance humanist and polymath Leonardo da Vinci is the poster child for multidisciplinary innovation: painter, draftsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor, and architect, his work spanned anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and paleontology. In today’s era of intelligence, the field of human-centered speculative design—which investigates the nexus between science, technology, and humans—will go through its own renaissance in the tech industry.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nSpeculative designers, creative technologists, and computational designers working with AI, hybrid, and mixed realities will be reshaping the very digital tools they have been using. They place less value on the product and more on the process and considerations around responsible and ethical AI.\n\nIn 2024, liberal arts universities will double down on programs which will, through research, new courses, and knowledge exchange, enable creatives to leverage code as a tool and AI as the material they shape. Core institutions include Stanford’s Human-Centered AI Lab and University of the Arts London’s Creative Computing Institute, established in 2020 at the intersection of creativity and computational technologies, where academics explore critical frameworks in decolonization, decarbonization, and issues of social justice.\n\nWe will see initiatives in creative and ethical technologies from Big Tech, and investment in sandboxes and incubators similar to the platform I founded, Open-Ended, looking at generative AI and large language models across the emerging technology spectrum.\n\nGoogle's creative tech-led AI team, Mural, is part of its machine learning research umbrella. Mural channels speculative design to consider how AI can benefit society and the planet to “question, provoke … and explore alternative imaginaries for AI,” and bring these back to Google’s core AI research. In 2024, Mural will partner with the University of Applied Arts in Vienna to engage AI with postindustrial and speculative design, led by lecturer Anab Jain.\n\nBy 2030, $134 billion will have been invested in immersive technologies, with a need for new content and ideas. We will see research-driven creative collaborations with robotics, gaming, and digital platforms. Artists who explore human and machine intelligence will propose a reconsideration of the formula-based concept of “intelligence” which is built into AI systems, to include creative intelligence, empathy, the intelligence of other species, as well as the wisdom of Indigenous cultures.\n\nSuch creatives are growing in number and influence. Polymathic choreographer Wayne McGregor is launching a project with Niantic in 2024 on the concept of “embodied physical intelligence.” Artists such as Es Devlin and Refik Anadol fuse art, science, and tech in interrogating and leveraging AI systems; they showcase their practice virtually and across the world, from the Museum of Modern Art to the World Economic Forum and UN General Assembly.\n\nIn 2024, how we design for AI will not be standalone. It will be woven into global issues: economic inequality, culture and creativity, geopolitics, the future of food, energy independence, and climate change. In the vein of the speculative design model, there is no need for clear “solutions”: There is a need for prioritizing creativity, humanity, and ecology.",

    "content": "In April 2022, when Dall-E, a text-to-image visio-linguistic model, was released, it purportedly attracted over a million users within the first three months. This was followed by ChatGPT, in January 2023, which apparently reached 100 million monthly active users just two months after launch. Both mark notable moments in the development of generative AI, which in turn has brought forth an explosion of AI-generated content into the web. The bad news is that, in 2024, this means we will also see an explosion of fabricated, nonsensical information, mis- and disinformation, and the exacerbation of social negative stereotypes encoded in these AI models.\n\nThe AI revolution wasn’t spurred by any recent theoretical breakthrough—indeed, most of the foundational work underlying artificial neural networks has been around for decades—but by the “availability” of massive data sets. Ideally, an AI model captures a given phenomena—be it human language, cognition, or the visual world—in a way that is representative of the real phenomena as closely as possible.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nFor example, for a large language model (LLM) to generate humanlike text, it is important the model is fed huge volumes of data that somehow represents human language, interaction, and communication. The belief is that the larger the data set, the better it captures human affairs, in all their inherent beauty, ugliness, and even cruelty. We are in an era that is marked by an obsession to scale up models, data sets, and GPUs. Current LLMs, for instance, have now entered an era of trillion-parameter machine-learning models, which means that they require billion-sized data sets. Where can we find it? On the web.\n\nThis web-sourced data is assumed to capture “ground truth” for human communication and interaction, a proxy from which language can be modeled on. Although various researchers have now shown that online data sets are often of poor quality, tend to exacerbate negative stereotypes, and contain problematic content such as racial slurs and hateful speech, often towards marginalized groups, this hasn’t stopped the big AI companies from using such data in the race to scale up.\n\nWith generative AI, this problem is about to get a lot worse. Rather than representing the social world from input data in an objective way, these models encode and amplify social stereotypes. Indeed, recent work shows that generative models encode and reproduce racist and discriminatory attitudes toward historically marginalized identities, cultures, and languages.\n\nIt is difficult, if not impossible—even with state-of-the-art detection tools—to know for sure how much text, image, audio, and video data is being generated currently and at what pace. Stanford University researchers Hans Hanley and Zakir Durumeric estimate a 68 percent increase in the number of synthetic articles posted to Reddit and a 131 percent increase in misinformation news articles between January 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023. Boomy, an online music generator company, claims to have generated 14.5 million songs (or 14 percent of recorded music) so far. In 2021, Nvidia predicted that, by 2030, there will be more synthetic data than real data in AI models. One thing is for sure: The web is being deluged by synthetically generated data.\n\nThe worrying thing is that these vast quantities of generative AI outputs will, in turn, be used as training material for future generative AI models. As a result, in 2024, a very significant part of the training material for generative models will be synthetic data produced from generative models. Soon, we will be trapped in a recursive loop where we will be training AI models using only synthetic data produced by AI models. Most of this will be contaminated with stereotypes that will continue to amplify historical and societal inequities. Unfortunately, this will also be the data that we will use to train generative models applied to high-stake sectors including medicine, therapy, education, and law. We have yet to grapple with the disastrous consequences of this. By 2024, the generative AI explosion of content that we find so fascinating now will instead become a massive toxic dump that will come back to bite us.",

    "content": "For researchers, social media has always represented greater access to data, more democratic involvement in knowledge production, and great transparency about social behavior. Getting a sense of what was happening—especially during political crises, major media events, or natural disasters—was as easy as looking around a platform like Twitter or Facebook. In 2024, however, that will no longer be possible.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nIn 2024, we will face a grim digital dark age, as social media platforms transition away from the logic of Web 2.0 and toward one dictated by AI-generated content. Companies have rushed to incorporate large language models (LLMs) into online services, complete with hallucinations (inaccurate, unjustified responses) and mistakes, which have further fractured our trust in online information.\n\nAnother aspect of this new digital dark age comes from not being able to see what others are doing. Twitter once pulsed with publicly readable sentiment of its users. Social researchers loved Twitter data, relying on it because it provided a ready, reasonable approximation of how a significant slice of internet users behaved. However, Elon Musk has now priced researchers out of Twitter data after recently announcing that it was ending free access to the platform’s API. This made it difficult, if not impossible, to obtain data needed for research on topics such as public health, natural disaster response, political campaigning, and economic activity. It was a harsh reminder that the modern internet has never been free or democratic, but instead walled and controlled.\n\nCloser cooperation with platform companies is not the answer. X, for instance, has filed a suit against independent researchers who pointed out the rise in hate speech on the platform. Recently, it has also been revealed that researchers who used Facebook and Instagram’s data to study the platforms’ role in the US 2020 elections had been granted “independence by permission” by Meta. This means that the company chooses which projects to share its data with and, while the research may be independent, Meta also controls what types of questions are asked and who asks them.\n\nWith elections coming in the US, India, Mexico, Indonesia, the UK, and the EU in 2024, the stakes are high. Until now, online “observatories” have been independently monitoring social media platforms for evidence of manipulation, inauthentic behavior, and harmful content. However, changes in data access by social media platforms, as well as the explosion of generative AI misinformation, means that the tools that researchers and journalists developed in prior national elections for monitoring online activity won’t work. One of my own collaborations, AI4TRUST, is developing new tools for combating misinformation, but our endeavor is stalled because of these changes.\n\nWe need to clean up our online platforms. The Center for Countering Digital Hate, a research, advocacy, and policy organization working to stop the spread of online hate and disinformation, has called for the adoption of its STAR Framework (Safety by Design, Transparency, Accountability, and Responsibility). This would ensure that digital products and services are safe before they are launched; increase transparency around algorithms, rule enforcement, and advertising; and work to hold companies both accountable to democratic and independent bodies, and responsible for omissions and actions that lead to harm. The EU’s Digital Services Act is a step in the right direction of regulation, including provisions to ensure that independent researchers can monitor social network platforms. However, these provisions will take years to be actionable. The UK’s Online Safety Bill—slowly making its way through the policy process—could also help, but again, these provisions will take time to implement. Until then, the transition from social media to AI-mediated information means that, in 2024, a new digital dark age will likely begin.",
