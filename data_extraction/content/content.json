    "content": "Problem\n\nI’ve submitted the issue described in this post to Apple as FB13375033. This issue has been open since September of 2023.\n\nIf you game on a MacBook display – your game is probably rendering wrong unless you’ve adjusted your settings. If you’re a developer building a full screen game in AppKit (or Catalyst) – Apple’s APIs have some issues you need to be aware of.\n\nWhen most games start – they ask the system what resolutions are available for the current display and pick the best one. A Mac app can get a list of suggested output resolutions through the CGDisplayCopyAllDisplayModes function. This worked well for decades on Macs with regular displays.\n\nThe problem with Apple laptops is they have a notch at the top of the display. The full screen area your game runs in is not the same resolution as the screen. Most games do not account for this problem. They output frames sized for the entire screen instead of the region they can draw to. This output is height compressed and blurry.\n\nLets start with how layout on a notched display works. Notched Mac displays have three different regions to be aware of.\n\nThe full bounds of the display. This isn’t explicitly marked on the diagram above. But it’s the entire display area including the menu and areas around the notch.\n\nThe safe area of the display. This includes the area of the display directly below the notch. AppKit exposes this property through NSScreen’s safeAreaInsets property.\n\nThe full screen area available for AppKit. This is distinct from the safe area. The full screen area extends from under the menu bar, while the safe area extends from below the notch.\n\nIf you’re an iOS developer – you’re probably already familiar with the idea of the safe area. But the Mac adds a third concept – the full screen app area. The safe area is the area below the notch. But the full screen area for a window is the area below the menu bar.\n\nWhich region does CGDisplayCopyAllDisplayModes return resolutions for? It actually returns resolutions for two regions:\n\nResolutions for the full area of the display (which are inaccessible for modern full screen AppKit apps.)\n\nResolutions for the area under the menu bar – which are relevant for full screen AppKit apps. On my MacBook Pro these resolutions are all 16:10.\n\nThe problem is that these resolutions are mixed in a single list with no built in way to filter.\n\nWorse yet – most games default to the first resolution on the list. That happens to be the resolution of the entire display instead of the area under the notch. Out of the box most games draw using this squashed down output that mismatched.\n\nHere’s a screenshot from Shadow of the Tomb Raider. The top slice is from the resolution it defaults to on my MacBook Pro – 3456 x 2234. That resolution includes the notch. But Shadows of the Tomb Raider can only draw below the notch – in a 3456 x 2160 area. This 74 pixel difference in view height creates a squashed image. The bottom slice is from the game running at the proper res of 3456 x 2160. The circle looks like much cleaner while the stretched circle at the top is blurry and crushed.\n\nNSScreen exposes a safeAreaInsets property – which feels like it should be helpful here. But – as we saw in the diagram – the safe area is still not the same as the available full screen area. So we can’t use the safe area as is.\n\nSolution\n\nIf you’re playing a game full screen on a notched display – make sure you’re picking a 16:10 resolution. Games you play probably will not default to the correct resolution.\n\nIf you’re a developer – the safe area can still be used to filter the resolution list. But we have to be a little clever about it. We need to look for resolutions that fit inside the safe area instead of ones that perfectly match it.\n\nextension NSScreen { func safeAreaResolutions() -> Array<CGDisplayMode> { let screenResolution = frame let safeAreaInset = safeAreaInsets let safeScreenResolution = CGSize( width: screenResolution.size.width - (safeAreaInset.left + safeAreaInset.right), height: screenResolution.size.height - (safeAreaInset.top + safeAreaInset.bottom) ) let safeAreaAspectRadio = safeScreenResolution.width / safeScreenResolution.height let screenNumber = deviceDescription[NSDeviceDescriptionKey.init(\"NSScreenNumber\")] as! CGDirectDisplayID guard let resolutions = CGDisplayCopyAllDisplayModes(screenNumber, nil) as? Array<CGDisplayMode> else { // We should never get here, the display should be valid fatalError() } return resolutions.filter { resolution in (CGFloat(resolution.width)/CGFloat(resolution.height)) > safeAreaAspectRadio } } }\n\nThis approach does have the side effect of being aggressive in its filtering. It loses some resolutions like the 4:3 ones.\n\nI’d love to see someone come up with a better approach or algorithm. But ultimately I think this is up to Apple to address.\n\nAffected Games\n\nI’ve already mentioned Shadow of the Tomb Raider, but here’s some other recent releases.\n\nOn my MacBook Pro – 3456 x 2234 is the resolution of my display. But 3456 x 2160 is the resolution under the menu bar available to a full screen game. That means we’re looking for 16:10 resolutions like 3456 x 2160.\n\nControl Ultimate Edition Control gets around the issue by just making up its own resolutions. There are a few 16:10 resolutions on the list – but none are the actual native resolution of my MacBook Pro.\n\nNo Man’s Sky No Man’s Sky defaults to a squashed, non 16:10 resolution. The resolution picker lists both safe area and non safe area resolutions.\n\nRiven Riven defaults to a squashed resolution.\n\nStray Stray defaults to 1728 x 1117 – which is not 16:10 and is squashed.\n\nCorrect Games\n\nCyberpunk 2077\n\nCyberpunk defaults to 1728×1080 – which is 16:10! It’s not clear how they’re filtering the resolution list. But the max resolution is 3456 x 2160 – which is the correct max resolution for a full screen app.\n\nHonorable Mention: World of Warcraft\n\nWorld of Warcraft at first looks wrong. But World of Warcraft is an older game using the legacy CoreGraphics display services full screen API. That API actually allows World of Warcraft to draw into the notch. So in this case the 3456×2234 resolution is correct.\n\nWhat Apple could do\n\nApple maintains a HIG for games the includes a section on building full screen games. But this issue isn’t mentioned anywhere. The HIG should be updated to describe the issues around the notch and how to fetch a resolution list.\n\nThe samples Apple provides on how to port a game don’t include any examples of picking output resolutions. Best practices for doing so should be included in the samples.\n\nCocoa applications should have the ability to filter the list down. I’d like to have an option to only see resolutions that are relevant to a full screen Cocoa app.\n\nBuild a new gaming centric API\n\nIt might be time for Apple to build a gaming centric API that can handle boilerplate like fetching a resolution list.\n\nAdvise game developers to not query display modes\n\nI don’t like the way Control handles resolutions. The developer seems to have hardcoded a list that is the same for any Mac. And I really want to have a list of resolutions that are relevant for my display.\n\nBut they might be on to something. There’s no requirement to render a game at any specific resolution. Applications can make up their own resolution list. You could calculate a list of resolutions on your view’s bounds. This would scale to any display or even windowed or full screen modes. Some games have implemented similar “render scale” settings that don’t even have a resolution list – just a scale.\n\nIf this is a good path forward – Apple should update their HIG and sample code.",

    "content": "August 14, 2025\n\nWe just completed rewriting the Ghostty GTK application fully embracing the GObject type system from Zig and also verifying with Valgrind every step of the way. The result is a more feature rich, stable, and maintainable Ghostty on Linux and BSD.\n\nThere are multiple interesting, technical topics from this process, but I want to focus in on two (1) interfacing with the GObject type system from Zig and (2) verifying a GTK application with Valgrind and reflecting on the memory issues Valgrind found in a Zig codebase.\n\nBackground\n\nFirst, some quick background. Ghostty is cross-platform (macOS, Linux, FreeBSD) terminal emulator. Ghostty sets itself apart from other cross-platform terminal emulators by using a platform-native application or GUI framework for each platform1.\n\nOn macOS, Ghostty is a multi-thousand line Swift application built with Xcode. On Linux and BSD, Ghostty is a multi-thousand line GTK application leveraging direct integrations with X11, Wayland, etc. Tying it all together, there is a very large shared core written in Zig that exports a C ABI compatible API.\n\nFor full motivation on why Ghostty was the way it was before and why we decided to rewrite the GTK application now, see the original \"gtk-ng\" PR. I'm going to keep this post focused on the takeaways rather than the motivation.\n\nGObject Type System and Zig\n\nWhatever your feelings are about OOP and memory management, the reality is that if you choose GTK, you're forced into interfacing in some way with the GObject type system. You can't avoid it.\n\nWell you can avoid it and we did avoid it. And it leads to a mess trying to tie the lifetimes of your non-reference-counted objects to the reference counted ones. There was an entire class of bug that kept popping up in the Ghostty GTK application that could basically be summed up as: the Zig memory or the GTK memory has been freed, but not both.\n\nBesides the correctness issues, avoiding the object system also forced us away from using GTK-native features such as signals (events), properties (which can be bound to by GUI elements), actions (invoking one-way behavior from afar), and more.\n\nLet's look at a concrete example: reloadable configuration. The configuration in Ghostty is represented by a Zig-owned Config structure. Many different parts of the GUI need to be aware of the configuration: windows, tabs, menus, splits, etc.\n\nReloading configuration was a complicated, CPU-intensive (relatively), and error-prone task because we had to ensure the entire GUI updated before we could free the old Config .\n\nNow, the Zig Config structure is wrapped in a reference-counted GhosttyConfig GObject. When we reload the config, we overwrite our property and let the GObject property change notification system ripple through the application (sometimes across multiple event loop ticks). When the old configuration no longer has any references, it frees. Conceptually much simpler.\n\nIn addition to memory management, we can now more easily create custom GTK widgets. This let us fully embrace modern GTK UI technologies such as Blueprint. For example, here is our terminal window Blueprint file. This has already led to more easily introducing GUI features like a new GTK titlebar tabs option, an animated border on bell, etc.\n\nValgrind with GTK and Zig\n\nThis topic deserves an entire blog post on its own. The gist of it is that from the first PR to the last, we've run every change and Ghostty feature through Valgrind and addressed any issues to ensure that there are no memory leaks, undefined memory access, etc.\n\nRunning Valgrind on a GTK application is pretty nasty. We need a pretty large suppression file. I know its a lot, but 80% of that file is provided by GTK itself. The remainder is primarily 3rd party libraries and GPU drivers. There are perhaps one or two suppressions I find suspicious (and commented as such).\n\nThe important part is we were able to identify a number of bugs along the way that would've definitely slipped under the radar. For example, I learned that if you forget to clear a GObject WeakRef during dispose, it'll cause undefined memory access in the target (referenced) object when it disposes at some point in the future (can be hours, days!). That undefined memory access happens to be fine 99% of the time, but once in awhile it causes a crash. Fun! Valgrind found this without problem.\n\nMemory safety seems to... erm... activate certain conversations. So let me say two things:\n\nOur Zig codebase had one leak and one undefined memory access. That was really surprising to me (in a good way). Our Zig codebase is large, complex, and uses tons of memory tricks for performance that could easily lead to unsafe behaviors. I thought we'd have a lot more issues, honestly. Also, the one leak found was during calling a 3rd party C API (so Zig couldn't detect it). So this is a huge success. Zig has a leak-detecting debug allocator and various safety checks that are only on during debug and test builds in the Ghostty project. Additionally, Zig has integrations with Valgrind. For example, Zig emits a Valgrind client request to mark some memory as undefined whenever you set a value as undefined (keyword) in Zig. This helps find even more issues. This experience has really shown me that this is working, despite not having any of these protections in our release builds. All other memory issues revolved around C API boundaries. Every other issue we found (and there were dozens) was directly within the complex lifetimes of the GObject system or on C API boundaries. My takeaway here is that you absolutely need tooling like Valgrind to safely call across C APIs (even if they're not written in C). For most complex libraries that expose a C API, the C API represents a boundary where object lifetime is transferred or blurred. Whatever language you're using to interact with it, the safety you're guaranteed is only as good as understanding the semantics of the API and writing a good wrapper.\n\nThe features Zig provides around memory safety are well documented. There are a lot of academic or theoretical discussions about what Zig does or does not do and whether that's good or bad. Those are valuable discussions to be had, but so are empirical results. This process is showing empirical results from a large, complex, multi-threaded, multi-platform Zig project when every individual feature is run with scrutiny under Valgrind. Takeaway from what what you want, I don't want to start any flame wars!\n\nGoing forward, I plan to continue to run every GTK PR within Valgrind and improving our project documentation so maintainers and contributors can do so as well (we already have a couple up and running!).\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is now my 5th time writing the GUI part of Ghostty from scratch: once with GLFW, once on macOS with SwiftUI, then on macOS with AppKit plus SwiftUI, once on Linux with GTK procedurally, and now on Linux with GTK and the full GObject type system.\n\nEach time, I've learned something new and valuable, and I've carried that experience into each iteration (and across platforms). Even this time, I've learned some new tricks that I plan on taking back over to macOS.\n\nI want to also highlight that the entire GTK subsystem maintenance team hopped on board to help complete the rewrite. They did a lot of work, too.",

    "content": "The 80’s was a decade of many things — excess, greed, and big hair, to name a few — but it was also the heyday for airbrush art. As a teenager in the late 80’s, I desperately wanted an airbrush so I could paint my favorite band logos on the back of my jean jacket, and maybe make some money on the side painting t-shirts and license plates. I thought those guys on the boardwalk selling custom shirts were gods — how could they produce such amazing works of art in just minutes?\n\nMy graduation gift from high school was an airbrush and a compressor, which I hauled off to college and used in my 10′ x 10′ dorm room with zero ventilation. The air would be thick with ink and I’d be sneezing black goo for days on end, but it was worth it if I could one day make it to the big leagues and get my own vendor’s stall at the local mall.\n\nMy tastes became a little more refined as I got older. Patrick Nagel posters hung on the walls of my first apartment — definitely more upscale than those palm trees and sunsets I once adored. I never did get very good with the airbrush, probably because I was introduced to computer design in school, and found it much easier. My airbrush nozzles would constantly get clogged, and an inconsistent compressor made things difficult while the computer was easy, clean, and odor-free. I wish I kept at it, but it’s just one of those things that got left behind.\n\nIn the 80’s airbrush art was everywhere — movies, arcades, television, advertisements. Palm trees, cherries, triangles, cyborg women, sunglasses, grids, and lightning — lots and lots of lightning — could be found airbrushed in every magazine on the newsstand.\n\nI always loved the chrome effect used in countless logos, and I still get a thrill when I watch an 80’s movie and a chrome logo comes on-screen — always on a black background, and usually with an awesome sound effect of metal hitting metal.\n\nA skilled artist can do things with an airbrush that just aren’t possible with other forms of painting — starbursts, layers, transparency, and speed lines like those the Yar’s Revenge box art — and just look at that metallic effect in the lettering!\n\nToday, you still find airbrush-inspired art in advertising that’s done digitally rather than with ink on paper. The digital art is a little too perfect though — the gradient blends are flawless, while an airbrush would give you the slightest inconsistencies that made it look more genuine.\n\nIt’s great to see homages to the 80’s such as this design by James White of Signalnoise for the Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon video game — chrome, check; grid, check; lightning, check. Yep, that’s the 80’s.\n\nIt’s unfortunate that the airbrush has been cast aside by many artists in favor of Photoshop or Illustrator. I keep telling myself that one of these days, I’ll dust off my old airbrush and give it another try. Maybe I’ll make t-shirts for everyone.",

    "content": "With a trip to Florence booked, all I want is to rewatch Medici. The 2016 historical drama series tells of the rise of the powerful Florentine banking dynasty, and with it, the story of the Renaissance. Until recently, I could simply have gone to Netflix and found it there, alongside a wide array of award-winning and obscure titles. But when I Google the show in 2025, the Netflix link only takes me to a blank page. I don’t see it on HBO Max, Disney+, Apple TV+, or any of the smaller streaming platforms. On Amazon Prime I am required to buy each of the three seasons or 24 episodes separately, whereupon they would be stored in a library subject to overnight deletion. Raised in the land of The Pirate Bay, the Swedish torrent index, I feel, for the first time in a decade, a nostalgia for the high seas of digital piracy. And I am not alone.\n\nThe Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.\n\nFor my teenage self in the 00s, torrenting was the norm. Need the new Coldplay album on your iPod? The Pirate Bay. The 1968 adaptation of Romeo and Juliet? The Pirate Bay. Whatever you needed was accessible with just a couple of clicks. But as smartphones proliferated, so did Spotify, the music streaming platform that is also headquartered in Sweden. The same Scandinavian country had become a hub of illegal torrenting and simultaneously conjured forth its solution.\n\n“Spotify would never have seen the light of day without The Pirate Bay,” Per Sundin, the then managing director of Universal Music Sweden, reflected in 2011. But music torrenting died out as we all either listened with ads or paid for the subscription. And when Netflix launched in Sweden in late 2012, open talk of torrenting moving images also stopped. Most of the big shows and a great collection of award-winning films could all be found for just 79 SEK (£6) a month. Meanwhile, the three founders of The Pirate Bay were arrested and eventually jailed. Pirating faded into the history books as far as I was concerned.\n\nIn Sweden, 25% of people reported pirating in 2024 – a trend driven by 15-24-year-olds\n\nA decade and a half on from the Pirate Bay trial, the winds have begun to shift. On an unusually warm summer’s day, I sit with fellow film critics by the old city harbour, once a haven for merchants and, rumour has it, smugglers. Cold bigstrongs in hand (that’s what they call pints up here), they start venting about the “enshittification” of streaming – enshittification being the process by which platforms degrade their services and ultimately die in the pursuit of profit. Netflix now costs upwards of 199 SEK (£15), and you need more and more subscriptions to watch the same shows you used to find in one place. Most platforms now offer plans that, despite the fee, force advertisements on subscribers. Regional restrictions often compel users to use VPNs to access the full selection of available content. The average European household now spends close to €700 (£600) a year on three or more VOD subscriptions. People pay more and get less.\n\nA fellow film critic confides anonymously: “I never stopped pirating, and my partner also does it if he doesn’t find the precise edition he is looking for on DVD.” While some people never abandoned piracy, others admit they have recently returned – this time turning to unofficial streaming platforms. One commonly used app is legal but can, through community add-ons, channel illicit streams. “Downloading is too difficult. I don’t know where to start,” says one film viewer. “The shady streams might bombard me with ads, but at least I don’t have to worry about getting hacked or caught.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Life on the open seas … Swedish-based filesharing website The Pirate Bay. Photograph: FocusDigital/Alamy\n\nAccording to London‑based piracy monitoring and content‑protection firm MUSO, unlicensed streaming is the predominant source of TV and film piracy, accounting for 96% in 2023. Piracy reached a low in 2020, with 130bn website visits. But by 2024 that number had risen to 216bn. In Sweden, 25% of people surveyed reported pirating in 2024, a trend mostly driven by those aged 15 to 24. Piracy is back, just sailing under a different flag.\n\n“Piracy is not a pricing issue,” Gabe Newell, the co-founder of Valve, the company behind the world’s largest PC gaming platform, Steam, observed in 2011. “It’s a service issue.” Today, the crisis in streaming makes this clearer than ever. With titles scattered, prices on the rise, and bitrates throttled depending on your browser, it is little wonder some viewers are raising the jolly roger again. Studios carve out fiefdoms, build walls and levy tolls for those who wish to visit. The result is artificial scarcity in a digital world that promised abundance.\n\nWhether piracy today is rebellion or resignation is almost irrelevant; the sails are hoisted either way. As the streaming landscape fractures into feudal territories, more viewers are turning to the high seas. The Medici understood the value linked to access. A client could travel from Rome to London and still draw on their credit, thanks to a network built on trust and interoperability. If today’s studios want to survive the storm, they may need to rediscover that truth.",

    "content": "Since launching Bluesky two years ago, we’ve grown tremendously. As our community has expanded, feedback on our terms of service, community guidelines, copyright, and privacy policies has surfaced opportunities to improve clarity. With more experience under our belt and an evolving regulatory landscape, we’re updating the language in our terms and policies to better explain our approach and provide more detail.\n\nFor our Community Guidelines, we’re asking for input from the community. The proposed guidelines enhance clarity, add user safety details, and provide more transparency around moderation. You’ll have until August 28th to submit comments, and then they’ll go into effect on October 15th. You can view our updated Community Guidelines on our Support Page.\n\nOur Terms of Service have been updated to reflect new legal requirements and give users more control in case of disagreements. Changes include clarifying eligibility and age assurance to comply with new regional regulations, as well as introducing a formal appeals process. We’ve also expanded our dispute resolution section to prioritize informal resolution.\n\nThe new Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Copyright Policy will go into effect on September 15th. You can view these updated policies on our Support Page.\n\nBelow is an overview of what’s being updated:\n\n1. Community Guidelines\n\nWe believe the best policies are created in partnership with the people they serve. Our draft Guidelines incorporate lessons from our community's growth and feedback, and your input will help us ensure they're ready to support Bluesky's future. We started by creating a draft that we think improves on our current Guidelines. Below are some of the updates we’ve proposed; here is the form to use for feedback.\n\nClearer Structure: Organized around four key principles—Safety First, Respect Others, Be Authentic, and Follow the Rules—with specific examples of allowed and prohibited content under each.\n\nOrganized around four key principles—Safety First, Respect Others, Be Authentic, and Follow the Rules—with specific examples of allowed and prohibited content under each. Harm Categories Clarified: Updated with more examples, to align with the UK Online Safety Act (OSA), the EU Digital Services Act (DSA), and the US TAKE IT DOWN Act.\n\nUpdated with more examples, to align with the UK Online Safety Act (OSA), the EU Digital Services Act (DSA), and the US TAKE IT DOWN Act. Enforcement Procedures: Introduced progressive enforcement model and clarified content moderation logic as required by the OSA and DSA.\n\nIntroduced progressive enforcement model and clarified content moderation logic as required by the OSA and DSA. Appeals & Redress: Aligned with the DSA and now includes out-of-court and judicial remedy guidance for EEA users.\n\n2. Terms of Service (ToS)\n\nEligibility and Age Assurance Section: Updated to clarify compliance with online safety laws and regulations (e.g., US Children's Online Privacy Protection Act [COPPA], OSA, DSA) and to require age assurance where necessary.\n\nUpdated to clarify compliance with online safety laws and regulations (e.g., US Children's Online Privacy Protection Act [COPPA], OSA, DSA) and to require age assurance where necessary. Moderation and Illegal Content: Added detail on proactive moderation and illegal content responses to comply with the DSA.\n\nAdded detail on proactive moderation and illegal content responses to comply with the DSA. Complaints and Appeals: Introduced detailed appeals process to comply with the DSA.\n\nIntroduced detailed appeals process to comply with the DSA. Dispute process: We have provided users with greater control in the event that we have a disagreement. We’ve added details about using the informal dispute resolution process, including an agreement that we will talk on the phone before proceeding to any formal dispute process. This is because we think most disputes can be resolved informally. We’ve added a specific detail around liability: if a user makes a claim that we did something wrong that caused certain types of harm, they can choose to resolve that claim in court rather than through arbitration. We are giving users a choice when it comes to any dispute we must resolve through arbitration. That means users choose one arbitrator, Bluesky chooses one arbitrator, and those two arbitrators choose a third.\n\nWe have provided users with greater control in the event that we have a disagreement.\n\n3. Privacy Policy\n\nUser Rights: Enhanced transparency around data subject rights under the EU and UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other global privacy laws.\n\nEnhanced transparency around data subject rights under the EU and UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other global privacy laws. International Data Transfers: Updated to explain safeguards used for transfers outside EU and UK.\n\nUpdated to explain safeguards used for transfers outside EU and UK.

    "content": "Today, we're adding a new, highly specialized tool to the Gemma 3 toolkit: Gemma 3 270M , a compact, 270-million parameter model designed from the ground up for task-specific fine-tuning with strong instruction-following and text structuring capabilities already trained in.\n\nThe last few months have been an exciting time for the Gemma family of open models. We introduced Gemma 3 and Gemma 3 QAT , delivering state-of-the-art performance for single cloud and desktop accelerators. Then, we announced the full release of Gemma 3n , a mobile-first architecture bringing powerful, real-time multimodal AI directly to edge devices. Our goal has been to provide useful tools for developers to build with AI, and we continue to be amazed by the vibrant Gemmaverse you are helping create, celebrating together as downloads surpassed 200 million last week.\n\nGemma 3 270M brings strong instruction-following capabilities to a small-footprint model. As shown by the IFEval benchmark (which tests a model's ability to follow verifiable instructions), it establishes a new level of performance for its size, making sophisticated AI capabilities more accessible for on-device and research applications.\n\nCore capabilities of Gemma 3 270M\n\nCompact and capable architecture: Our new model has a total of 270 million parameters: 170 million embedding parameters due to a large vocabulary size and 100 million for our transformer blocks. Thanks to the large vocabulary of 256k tokens, the model can handle specific and rare tokens, making it a strong base model to be further fine-tuned in specific domains and languages.\n\nExtreme energy efficiency: A key advantage of Gemma 3 270M is its low power consumption. Internal tests on a Pixel 9 Pro SoC show the INT4-quantized model used just 0.75% of the battery for 25 conversations, making it our most power-efficient Gemma model.\n\nInstruction following: An instruction-tuned model is released alongside a pre-trained checkpoint. While this model is not designed for complex conversational use cases, it’s a strong model that follows general instructions right out of the box.\n\nProduction-ready quantization: Quantization-Aware Trained (QAT) checkpoints are available, enabling you to run the models at INT4 precision with minimal performance degradation, which is essential for deploying on resource-constrained devices.\n\n\n\nThe right tool for the job\n\nIn engineering, success is defined by efficiency, not just raw power. You wouldn't use a sledgehammer to hang a picture frame. The same principle applies to building with AI.\n\nGemma 3 270M embodies this \"right tool for the job\" philosophy. It's a high-quality foundation model that follows instructions well out of the box, and its true power is unlocked through fine-tuning. Once specialized, it can execute tasks like text classification and data extraction with remarkable accuracy, speed, and cost-effectiveness. By starting with a compact, capable model, you can build production systems that are lean, fast, and dramatically cheaper to operate.\n\n\n\nA real-world blueprint for success\n\nThe power of this approach has already delivered incredible results in the real world. A perfect example is the work done by Adaptive ML with SK Telecom. Facing the challenge of nuanced, multilingual content moderation, they chose to specialize. Instead of using a massive, general-purpose model, Adaptive ML fine-tuned a Gemma 3 4B model. The results were stunning: the specialized Gemma model not only met but exceeded the performance of much larger proprietary models on its specific task.\n\nGemma 3 270M is designed to let developers take this approach even further, unlocking even greater efficiency for well-defined tasks. It's the perfect starting point for creating a fleet of small, specialized models, each an expert at its own task.\n\nBut this power of specialization isn't just for enterprise tasks; it also enables powerful creative applications.

    "content": "August 13, 2025・6 minute read\n\nHere it is showing the build of a macOS app:\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nBefore I explain what you’re looking at, here’s some background:\n\nSometimes software takes a long time to compile just due to how much code it has, like in the LLVM project. But often a build is slower than it could be for dumb, fixable reasons. I’ve had the suspicion that most builds are doing dumb stuff, but I had no way to see it. So I’ve been working on a cross-platform tool to help visualize builds (you can try it, see below). It works with any build system and any programming language (Not just C/C++/Rust).\n\nIt’s more than just a generic system profiler: it looks for build-specific problems. A few examples: using make without the -j flag, disproportionate time being spent on certain files or compiler phases (as reported by tools like clang’s -ftime-trace ), and commands that could’ve been run in parallel but weren’t. It’s especially helpful for optimizing CI builds, which are often clean rebuilds.\n\nI named it What the Fork after the fork() system call that spawns new processes. You use it by writing wtf before a build command:\n\n$ # A few possible examples: $ wtf make $ wtf cargo build $ wtf gradle build $ wtf npm run build $ wtf zig build $ wtf -x # starts a build of the front most Xcode window\n\nAnd that launches the UI, which updates as the build progresses.\n\nThe UI shows each process in a build represented as a box, colored according to its type. The processes are laid out in timeline order from left to right. Child processes are shown nested below their parent. The panel at the bottom of the window shows information about the selected process: how long it ran, the working directory, and the full command with arguments.\n\nHow it works\n\nA build is just a bunch of commands that produce your finished program. At its simplest, it could be a shell script like this:\n\n#!/bin/bash clang main.c -o program\n\nThat script requires 3 programs to produce the final result: bash , clang , and — surprise! — ld , the linker, which clang runs automatically. Unexpected build steps are often the source of slowdowns and are even more likely in bigger projects, which often use something like cargo , make , bazel , gradle , or xcodebuild instead of a shell script. Those tools still just execute commands, but they also perform caching, dependency analysis, and scheduling to do the least amount of work as efficiently as possible.\n\nWhile it is possible to see commands run by a build tool in the terminal output, that doesn’t tell you what commands those commands run (like clang running ld ) and doesn’t include detailed timing! So if we want to see everything a build does, we need to listen for the system calls that start and terminate processes: fork , exec , and exit . Each operating system has a its own way to do that:\n\nmacOS has the Endpoint Security API\n\nLinux has ptrace()\n\nWindows has the “Worst API Ever Made”: Event Tracing for Windows\n\nEach of those API are a pain to use for different reasons, but they do provide the information required to reconstruct a timeline. Here is our simple shell script’s execution visualized in the macOS version of What the Fork .\n\nKeen readers will have noticed that these techniques allow the app to be used on any type of program that launches sub-processes - not just builds! If you have any ideas for how that might be useful outside of build optimization, let me know.\n\nThings I’ve Noticed\n\nBeing able to see your build reveals a lot. I’ve had engineers from Delta, Mozilla, and Apple try the tool on their projects and each one found something unexpected. Let me give you some examples.\n\nI’ll start with an open source project that uses cargo to build. I’m going to zoom in on the compilation of a single dependency:\n\nOops! No parallelism! Files are compiled one at a time. It could be about 10 times faster if cargo ran multiple commands at once on my 10 core M1 CPU. I’d have never noticed this without a timeline visualization. If you want to see what good parallelism looks like, check out how ninja builds the llvm project:\n\nEvery core of my machine is kept busy the entire time. It’s actually slightly over-subscribed with 12 jobs in flight on my 10 core machine, which is intentional in case some jobs are blocked on IO. Perfection. Perfect is boring though, lets look at a problem. Here’s a tiny slice of a CMake build from another open source project:\n\nHere CMake gets Xcode’s path with xcode-select -print-path , the OS version with sw_vers , and then recursively calls cmake/make a few times for good measure, and finally compiles and links a file.\n\nOnly the green boxes in that timeline are doing useful work. One could argue that none of what CMake does is “useful work”, in the sense that it just builds the thing that actually builds the project. Regardless, let’s just accept that CMake needs to do this weird cmake->make->make->clang dance to figure out the build environment.\n\nZooming out reveals that the weird dance happens 85 times!\n\nYikes, no parallelism. It also studiously re-checks the Xcode path and OS version 85 times, just in case the OS version changes mid-build.\n\nOk enough about cmake. There are other builds to explore! Here’s xcodebuild building a 100,000 line Objective-C project:\n\nNotice how it has gaps towards the end of the build where it only has one or two clang processes running, even when there is a lot more to do.\n\nIt also has 6 seconds of inactivity before starting any useful work. For comparison, ninja takes 0.4 seconds to start compiling the 2,468,083 line llvm project. Ninja is not a 100% fair comparison to other tools, because it benefits from some “baked in” build logic by the tool that created the ninja file, but I think it’s a reasonable “speed of light” performance benchmark for build systems.\n\nContinuing our tour of various builds, here’s Zig compiling the Orca Project:\n\nWhat’s interesting here is that zig build builds dependencies in a random order (To expose ordering problems due to misconfigured builds). That means that sometimes it gets lucky with the ordering, like in the previous image where it’s fast. But sometimes it’s unlucky, like below where the curl dependency got scheduled at the verrrry end, so it doesn’t have any parallelism with the rest of the project:\n\nAnd finally, here’s make/go compiling the github cli project:\n\nThat big blank area towards the left is all the project’s dependencies being downloaded, so if I wanted to speed up this project’s clean builds, I’d focus on reducing dependencies first. Dependencies are kind of a build-double-whammy because guess what those long “compile” commands are: the dependencies go-control-plane , protobuf , gojq , etc.\n\nThat’s just a sampling of the things I’ve learned by visualizing builds. Of course there are more nuanced issues you can find by looking at a process’s full command, but today I wanted to focus on things that I could show visually.\n\nEarly Access",

    "content": "University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) researchers, along with their colleagues, engineered a new molecule that appears promising as an effective antidote for carbon monoxide poisoning with fewer side effects than other molecules currently being tested, according to a new study published in the journal PNAS.\n\nCarbon monoxide poisoning accounts for 50,000 emergency room visits in the U.S. each year and causes about 1,500 deaths. These deaths may occur when carbon monoxide released from combustion builds up in an enclosed space, which can result from ventilation failures in indoor natural gas burning equipment, or running gasoline generators or automobiles indoors or in a closed garage. Carbon monoxide poisoning is also associated with most fires from smoke inhalation.\n\nCurrently, the only treatments for carbon monoxide poisoning are oxygen-based therapies, which help the body eliminate the toxic gas. However, even with treatment, nearly half of survivors suffer long-term heart and brain damage. This has created an urgent need for faster, more effective therapies.\n\nIn the new study, the research team developed a new engineered protein-based therapy called RcoM-HBD-CCC, which acts like a sponge to soak up carbon monoxide from the blood. Beginning with RcoM (short for “regulator of metabolism”)—a natural protein the bacterium Paraburkholderia xenovorans uses to sense minute levels of carbon monoxide—the researchers engineered a version that is highly selective: It grabs carbon monoxide without interfering with oxygen or other important molecules in the body.\n\nIn tests on mice, the new therapy worked quickly to remove carbon monoxide from red blood cells and was safely flushed out of the body through urine. “Unlike other protein-based treatments, we found the compound caused only minimal changes in blood pressure, which was an exciting finding and raised the potential for this new molecule to have clinical applications,” said study corresponding author Mark T. Gladwin, MD, Dean of UMSOM who is also the Vice President for Medical Affairs, University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB), and the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor. “This has the potential to become a rapid, intravenous antidote for carbon monoxide that could be given in the emergency department or even in the field by first-responders.”\n\nHow Carbon Monoxide Kills\n\nIn healthy bodies, oxygen inhaled from the air binds to the protein hemoglobin on the surface of red blood cells, which then ferry the oxygen to all the tissues of the body. Inhaled poisonous carbon monoxide gas, however, competes with oxygen for hemoglobin. It enters the bloodstream and binds to hemoglobin with a 200 to 400-fold greater affinity than oxygen. That means carbon monoxide hogs most of the hemoglobin seats, so not enough oxygen molecules can get a ride to the tissues that need them.\n\nCurrently, the only available treatments for carbon monoxide poisoning involve giving 100 percent pure oxygen, sometimes under pressure in a hyperbaric chamber.\n\nAll too often, patients are not transported, diagnosed, and treated in time to reverse the effects of carbon monoxide poisoning, which can cause lasting cardiac and neurological injuries or even death.\n\n“This molecule could be a game-changer because it can directly and rapidly remove carbon monoxide from the body with such a low risk of off-target side effects,” said Jason J. Rose, MD, MBA, Associate Professor of Medicine, Division Chief of Pulmonary, Critical Care & Sleep Medicine, and one of the study’s researchers. “Given the promising results, we also see the potential for RcoM-HBD-CCC use in other areas, like as a blood substitute in severe anemia or hemorrhagic shock.”\n\nBloodstream Scavengers\n\nThe research team focused on engineering carbon monoxide “scavengers,” which are proteins structurally similar to hemoglobin, known as hemoproteins, but exhibiting even greater binding affinity — stickiness — for carbon monoxide, and less affinity for binding oxygen.\n\nInfused in the bloodstream, scavenger hemoproteins like RcoM-HBD-CCC rapidly bind to carbon monoxide molecules, reducing the time it takes to clear half of the carbon monoxide in the blood to less than a minute, compared to more than hour with pure oxygen therapy and five hours without any treatment. When carbon monoxide is cleared, this frees hemoglobin on red blood cells to begin carrying oxygen once again.\n\nBut many hemoproteins also share some affinity for binding oxygen, and can therefore also scavenge nitric oxide, a molecule important in regulating blood pressure. Infusions of hemoproteins or hemoglobin can reduce the levels of nitric oxide in the blood, leading to tightened blood vessels and a rapid rise in blood pressure.\n\nIn this latest study, the researchers were surprised to find that RcoM-HBD-CCC did not result in an increase in blood pressure regardless of whether carbon monoxide was present in the blood. They theorize that while RcoM-HBD-CCC may scavenge nitric oxide, a blood-pressure regulating molecule, it may do so more slowly than other hemoproteins, leading to its safer profile.\n\nFuture studies will likely include more pre-clinical research to determine the safe and effective dosage range for RcoM-HBD-CCC in treating carbon monoxide poisoning. It could also form the basis for new research in other fields, including as an oxygen delivery therapy or blood substitute. This could include hemorrhagic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe anemias, and the preservation of organs for transplantation.\n\nDr. Rose and Dean Gladwin are co-founders and directors of Globin Solutions, which has licensed technology based on RcoM from the University of Pittsburgh towards the development of a CO poisoning antidote. Dr Rose is President and CEO of Globin Solutions. Globin Solutions has sponsored research agreements with UMB.\n\nAbout the University of Maryland School of Medicine\n\nThe University of Maryland School of Medicine, established in 1807 as the first public medical school in the U.S., continues today as one of the fastest growing, top-tier biomedical research enterprises in the world.

    "content": "Palantir is arguably one of the most notorious corporations in contemporary America. Cofounded by libertarian tech billionaire Peter Thiel, the software firm's work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the US Department of Defense, and the Israeli military has sparked numerous protests in multiple countries. Palantir has been so infamous for so long that, for some people, its name has become a cultural shorthand for dystopian surveillance.\n\nBut a number of former Palantir employees tell WIRED they believe the public still largely misunderstands what the company actually does and how its software works. Some people think it's a data broker that buys information from private companies and resells it to the government. Others think it’s a data miner, constantly scanning the internet for unique insights it can collect and market to customers. Still others think it maintains a giant, centralized database of information collected from all of its clients. In reality, Palantir does none of these things, but the misconceptions continue to persist.\n\nPalantir has tried to correct the record itself in a series of blog posts with titles like “Palantir Is Not a Data Company” and “Palantir Is Still Not a Data Company.” In the latter, Palantir explains that “misconceptions can arise because our products are complicated,” but nonetheless, “it is absolutely possible” to accurately describe them to “people who are curious.”\n\nThe problem, however, is that even ex-employees struggle to provide a clear description of the company. “It's really hard to explain what Palantir works on or what it does,” says Linda Xia, who was an engineer at Palantir from 2022 to 2024. “Even as someone who worked there, it's hard to figure out, how do you give a cohesive explanation?”\n\nXia was one of 13 former Palantir staffers who signed an open letter published in May arguing that the company risks being complicit in authoritarianism by continuing to cooperate with the Trump administration. She and other former Palantir staffers who spoke to WIRED for this story argue that, in order to grapple with Palantir and its role in the world, let alone hold the company accountable, you need to first understand what it really is.\n\nIt’s not that former employees literally don’t know what Palantir is selling. In interviews with WIRED, they spoke fluidly about how its software can connect and transform different kinds of data collected by government agencies and corporations. But when asked to, say, name its direct business competitors, two former Palantir employees who requested anonymity to speak freely about their experiences, struggled to come up with anything. “I still don't know how to answer that question, to be honest,” says one.\n\nJuan Sebastián Pinto, who worked as a content strategist at Palantir and also signed the open letter, says it sells software to other businesses, a category commonly referred to in Silicon Valley as B2B SaaS. Another former staffer says Palantir provides “really extravagant plumbing with data.”",

    "content": "Oxford University is immersed in the past like no other place I’ve seen.\n\nOne example: when I was a visiting student at Oxford in 2005, I remember meeting two students at a pub one evening. They were drinking ivy-laced beer. The reason, I was told, is that centuries ago, a student from Lincoln College had murdered a student of Brasenose. Ever since then, Brasenose students had been allowed into Lincoln and given free beer once a year.\n\nHere’s the event back in 1938:\n\nThe actual truth behind “ivy ale day” is unclear — accounts of it usually use phrases like “some half-remembered collegiate slight.” But I found this description from 1904, which in turn cites a reference dating back to 1604.\n\nThere are many more stories like this, all circling around Oxford’s unusual relationship to history and to time.\n\nThe ultimate example may be All Souls College, which has a ritual, the Mallard Song, that occurs once a century. Here’s how Wikipedia describes it:\n\nIn the ceremony, Fellows parade around the college with flaming torches, led by a \"Lord Mallard\" who is carried in a chair, in search of a giant mallard that supposedly flew out of the foundations of the college when it was being built in 1437. The procession is led by an individual carrying a duck — originally dead, now just wooden — tied to the end of a vertical pole. The ceremony was last held in 2001, with Martin Litchfield West acting as Lord Mallard.\n\nAll Souls is also the home of the famed All Souls Examinations, which have been called the most difficult exams in the world. That seems an impossible thing to measure. But I do think a strong case could be made that these exams are the world’s most eccentric. In the rest of this post, I’ll argue that the All Souls exams are newly relevent as we confront the fact that frontier AI models have totally destabilized how we do academic assessment, and indeed how we think about thinking and writing in general. Most tests and exams prioritize giving the median answer — the one that experts tend to converge on as “right.” These do something different, in a way that we can learn from.\n\nShare\n\nPedantry, Purity, Prejudice, Play\n\nBack in 2005, I thought of the college’s legendarily strange assessment system as an antiquated, Victorian-era holdover. In 2025, I see it differently.\n\nUniquely among any other academic institution I’ve ever heard of, All Souls is not really open to students at all. It does not offer undergraduate classes, and it has no traditional admissions process, even for grad students. Instead, it offers seven-year-long Examination Fellowships.\n\nA photo of All Souls I took in 2005.\n\nHere is the selection criteria, from the All Souls website:\n\nThe College sets a written examination, consisting of four papers of three hours each. Two of these are in your chosen specialist subject… The other two papers are 'general', and contain questions on a wide range of subjects. In previous years, candidates sat a fifth paper, in which they were required to write an essay in response to a single word; this is no longer the case.\n\nA few things stand out here. First, that is a lot of time to spend writing essays: twelve hours in all, sitting in a room, with pencil and paper and a short list of questions.\n\nSecond, notice the (now discontinued) single word essay. Yes, three hours answering a question that consisted of a single word.\n\nI have written before about the historical research abilities of language models, which are getting quite proficient at tasks like translation, text transcription, image analysis, and making thematic and conceptual links between genres, time periods, and settings — all very useful tools for historians:\n\nBut despite this, I am also struck by the continued failure of frontier models when it comes to originality in writing. This can include creative writing, but the concept of originality in writing has a much wider scope than fiction. All Soul’s College examinations very much fall under that heading. To be sure, they are designed to do multiple things at once, including testing test raw knowledge and recall in a range of disciplines (the 2024 exams had specialist sections for Classical Studies, Economics, English Literature, History, Law, Philosophy, and Politics).\n\nBut it is quite clear that they also test the ability to write from an opinionated, individual point of view about these topics. This is especially clear in the “General Paper” (the questions all applicants must answer). These seem purpose-built to evade any answer which consists of rote memorization of facts.\n\nHere are the first few. You can read the complete list here:\n\nAnd here are some of the specialist questions in history for 2024:\n\nMy honest opinion of these questions is that they are uneven and in some cases performatively “clever.”\n\nBut I deeply admire the implicit ethos of education in them. Yes, you should have a storehouse of facts in your head, laboriously gained through study. But you should also be willing to write essays in the original, Michel de Montaigne sense of the term — personally grounded explorations of uncertain intellectual terrain.\n\nThe question about cultural historians and ice cores is one I love for this reason: there is no “right” answer to it, no rubric that could be applied. It’s a brilliant prompting for thinking deeply about the current state of historical research and how it relates to the environmental sciences and the study of climate change. It is also, implicitly, a question that invites disagreement — I wonder what percentage of respondents argued that cultural historians shouldn’t care, and how such responses were scored. There are a lot of meta-level considerations like this embedded within these prompts, the full list of which is available here.\n\nAnd as for the famous single word essay prompts? Wikipedia has a complete list here. Here is the first entry:\n\n1914: Culture\n\nAnd the last five:\n\n2005: Style\n\n2006: Water\n\n2007: Harmony\n\n2008: Novelty\n\n2009: Reproduction\n\nThe jagged frontier of machine reasoning\n\nEthan Mollick often writes about the concept of a “jagged frontier” of AI reasoning ability, and that is very much in evidence here. There are many questions on the All Souls lists which the leading frontier models can answer extremely ably.\n\nFor instance, GPT-5 (full answer here) and Claude Opus 4.1 (answer) can both do an excellent job on the one about Achaemenid Persia as a template for Sassanian power. Claude’s answer to this question is, in my opinion, astonishingly good, since it leverages the superhuman linguistic and geographic knowledge of LLMs to excellent effect.\n\nBut give these two leading AI models the task of writing a lengthy essay on the topic of “water,” and they immediately spin off into BS. The lower-powered LLMs, like GPT-5’s non-reasoning variant, will tend to provide encyclopedia entry-type answers to these prompts, mentioning a grab bag of facts about water, or culture, or the like. That’s such an obviously bad strategy that I find it hard to imagine any human choosing it (“I have three hours to write about the concept of novelty? Let me list some things that are new…”)\n\nClaude Opus 4.1 tries to be more tactical, but it ends up sounding like a pompous windbag from the very first sentence:\n\nWater—that most paradoxical of substances, simultaneously the most common and the most extraordinary, the most transparent and the most opaque to understanding—presents itself as perhaps the supreme test of intellectual synthesis. To examine water is to confront the fundamental tensions between materiality and metaphor, between scientific precision and humanistic interpretation, between the molecular and the civilizational.\n\nGPT-5 Thinking is much the same, just with more purple prose:\n\nTo write “water” is to trace a braid of physics, ecology, technology, culture, and power. This essay follows that braid.\n\nYuck.\n\nNot long after GPT-5’s release, Michael Nielsen asked:\n\nStill, none of the AI models can write. Is this the grounding problem? The models' reality is the words they were trained on; good writers also train on lots of words, but are in addition wonderful observers of a much broader reality. The writers' world models seem much deeper as a result, and there can be a compelling unity in the writing. It's puzzling, because the models can be very helpful in critiquing and improving writing. And occasionally they produce beautiful phrases or sentences. But they still seem to me ungrounded in some important way\n\nIt’s a good question. These one word prompts are a perfect example of Nielsen’s point. Consider the following words, all prompts from past versions of the All Souls exam:\n\nPain, Sin, Space, Self-deception, Miracles, Bias, Style\n\nWhat do they evoke for you? It is literally impossible for me to say, because your understanding of each of them is profoundly shaped by your life experience, your sensory perception, your unconscious, your childhood, and a million other things grounded in actually operating in a physical world.\n\nBy contrast, even though I found Claude Opus 4.1’s answer to the ancient Persia question shockingly good, I also noticed that it had a remarkably similar structure to GPT-5’s answer. Both began by pointing to the same inscription and making much the same argument about it. The same patterns emerge for all LLM answers to these questions. They converge on an optimal path through a thicket of concepts. They rarely, if ever, surprise.\n\nIf exams like All Souls outline the negative space around LLM capabilities in humanistic reasoning — and I think they do — then that makes this format and type of reasoning more important than it was before. Being able to improvise brilliantly for three hours on the topic of Miracles or Self-Deception or Harmony might come off as unnecessary and even pompous. And to be blunt, it probably is. There’s a reason why All Souls dropped the one word questions.\n\nBut — to be able to think on your feet, with originality, creativity, and verve, in a way that is grounded in both a wide-ranging knowledge of facts and a thoughtful, probing, deeply individualistic sense of your subjective opinions, memories, sense experiences, and intuitions about a topic? That pretty much sums up what I think will be the lasting value, and the new goal, of humanistic education in the 2020s and 2030s.\n\nNever again will humans be able to give a better answer than a machine on questions like the one about Achaemenid Persia. That sort of question has already had its AlphaGo moment.\n\nBut not all of them have, or will.\n\nShare\n\nWeekly links\n\n• “Construction, Hotel, Hotel, Hotel, Ceremonial paper goods, Restaurant, Wine, Mint, Religious Goods, Mint”: the occupations of the world’s oldest extant companies, ranging from the sixth to 9th centuries CE. Discussed in “Slow,” an interesting list of extremely slow-burning human projects by the afore-mentioned Michael Nielsen.\n\n• A firsthand account from 2022 of an Oxford student’s experience taking the All Souls Exam, posted on Reddit “in the public interest of making the whole thing less secretive and weird.”\n\n• Sixteenth-century mariners had no real knowledge of Australia. Yet this did not stop the Spanish Empire from claiming possession of all territory from the Straits of Magellan to the South Pole, as the Governate of Terra Australis. In 1539 this land signed over to a single man, Pedro Sánchez de la Hoz. According to Wikipedia: “Given that Chile and Argentina have historically successfully established their border based on the uti possidetis iuris principle of international law, the Sánchez de la Hoz grant forms part of their arguments for territorial claims in Antarctica.”\n\nLeave a comment",

    "content": "From wildfires in Canada to flooding in India, people across the world are dealing with the realities of climate change. The world recorded its highest temperatures ever this summer and the climate models for 2100 make sobering reading.\n\nTo tackle climate change we need a data-driven approach, using technology to help decarbonize the sectors that contribute to it. The transportation sector is the largest contributor to climate change in the US and Europe. Simply put, travel is in need of a long-overdue update. The good news is that, in 2024, we will kickstart that much needed moment for green mobility.\n\nThe International Energy Agency estimates 55 percent of the reductions needed to cut all greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 are linked to everyday consumer choices, particularly driving.\n\nOver two-thirds of consumers cite the lack of electric charging stations as the biggest barrier to buying electric vehicles (EVs). However, new legislation, such as the European Green Deal and universal EV charging standards in the US, will help to put new chargers on the road.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nThe infrastructure is growing, but the information is still catching up. That’s why, to empower drivers with the information they need, Google has updated its Search experience to make it easier to research the costs and incentives associated with EVs. Google Maps also shows nearby EV chargers and offers eco-friendly routing—providing directions optimized for fuel or battery efficiency. In 2024, drivers will not only be able to more easily purchase an electric vehicle, they will be able to more easily charge them. The theory is simple: When billions of people have the tools to make more informed decisions, meaningful change is possible.\n\nThe impact of individuals grows exponentially when coupled with systemic investments by government officials and business leaders. We all know the feeling of impatience when waiting for the light to turn green. It’s not just an inconvenience, it’s bad for the environment—US Department of Energy data suggests that eliminating idling vehicles is equivalent to taking 5 million cars off American roads. In partnership with local governments, Google (where I am the chief sustainability officer) recently expanded Project Green Light—which leverages AI to improve traffic light efficiency—to 12 cities around the world. Early results show there’s potential to reduce the number of vehicle stops by up to 30 percent, lowering emissions for up to 30 million car trips monthly.\n\nYet, we cannot focus exclusively on cars—providing sustainable public transport is also vital. Nowhere is the value clearer than in Japan, a leader in high-speed rail. One passenger traveling between Tokyo and Osaka emits 4.2 kilograms of carbon dioxide—one-twelfth the emissions of a passenger on a Tokyo-Osaka flight. That's why it's so important for people to have information on alternative, climate-friendly modes of transport at their fingertips—including comparable train routes, biking, and walking suggestions. This also illustrates the potential impact of projects like the Brightline train, designed to connect Los Angeles and Las Vegas by electric, high-speed rail.\n\nAlong with opportunities on roads and rails, in 2024 we will make progress on our skies. Aviation is responsible for 3.5 percent of global warming—35 percent of which is non-emissions related. The culprit? Contrails—the feathery white trails created by airplanes. They may look harmless, but they trap heat inside the Earth’s atmosphere. Using AI-based technology, Google partnered with American Airlines and Breakthrough Energy to reduce contrails by 54 percent—achieving the first proof point of verifiable and cost-effective contrail avoidance. Delta Airlines, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and others are also working to tackle the issue. In 2024, clean mobility will move closer to the norm across transportation, not the exception.",

    "content": "In 2024, fusion technology will finally make the transition from basic research to commercial application. The reason for that will be the construction and completion of the first commercial fusion demonstrators. These cutting-edge facilities are smaller than fusion power plants. For instance, a laser-based fusion demonstrator might use five to ten laser beams, while a commercial power plant can use several hundred. However, they have a crucial role—to prove that fusion technology works on a small scale, paving the way for the construction of larger fusion-power plants. In 2024, they will do just this, starting to build devices that will finally achieve the elusive goal of energy gain– in other words, outputting more energy than the quantity needed to kickstart the fusion process. Hitting this milestone is a critical step in addressing the steeply increasing global energy demand, as fusion energy has the potential to provide an abundant, carbon-free source of power.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nIn 2022, researchers at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) in California became the first to demonstrate experimentally that a fusion process could indeed produce a net energy gain. This experiment used high-power lasers to deposit energy in a small fuel target—a millimeter-sized capsule containing frozen deuterium and tritium—creating the conditions for fusion to occur. The lasers delivered 2.05 megajoules of energy to the target, resulting in a fusion energy production of 3.1 megajoules. This was a scientific experiment—unlike fusion demonstrators, the NIF is not designed to operate continuously like a power plant. However, as a result of this scientific breakthrough, nuclear fusion has attracted considerable research, political, and investor attention in recent months.\n\nNational fusion strategies have been developed in the US, UK, Japan, Germany, and other countries to advance research and testing of the technology. Currently, the US and the UK are leading the race: The US Department of Energy funds fusion research with an annual budget of about $1.4 billion and encourages private enterprises to accelerate commercialization. The UK similarly fosters public-private partnership by raising a fusion cluster with universities and companies combining their expertise. High-profile investors recognize the opportunity of fusion technology, with over $5 billion of private capital flowing into fusion companies in the last two years.\n\nThe initiatives are bearing fruit: Several fusion companies worldwide, including Commonwealth Fusion Systems, Helion Energy, and General Fusion have announced plans to begin constructing facilities in 2024 to demonstrate their technological approach. According to the latest report by the Fusion Industry Association, over half of all fusion companies believe that fusion energy will be delivered to the public power grid during the 2030s. In May 2023, Microsoft signed a power purchase agreement with Helion Energy, to secure a supply of fusion-generated electricity by 2028. In August 2023, Marvel Fusion (a fusion energy firm I cofounded) announced a partnership with Colorado State University worth $150 million, the largest public-private partnership to date, with the aim of building the only laser facility tailored to a commercial laser-based fusion technology and the most powerful short-pulse laser system in the world. With these advances and commitments in place, 2024 is set to show that fusion is no longer a distant dream but an achievable future of clean and sustainable energy.",

    "content": "Much like the internet did in the 1990s, AI is going to change the very definition of work. While change can be scary, if the last three years taught us anything, it can also be an opportunity to reinvent how we do things. I believe the best way to manage the changes ahead for employees and employers alike is to adopt a skills-first mindset.\n\nFor employees, this means thinking about your job as a collection of tasks instead of a job title, with the understanding that those tasks will change regularly as AI advances. By breaking down your job into tasks that AI can fully take on, tasks for which AI can improve your efficiency, and tasks that require your unique skills, you can identify the skills you should actually be investing in to stay competitive in the job you have.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nAfter all, the skills required for many jobs have changed by a staggering 25 percent since 2015, and that number is expected to reach at least 65 percent by 2030 due to the rapid development of new technologies such as AI. And it’s not just skills related to AI literacy—people skills are rising in importance. Our data shows the top skills that professionals think will become more important as AI tools become more widely used at work are problem solving, strategic thinking, and time management.\n\nAs for employers, the rise of AI only increases the importance of a skills-based approach to hiring and developing talent. People are learning AI skills at a rapid clip, with the number of AI-skilled members now nine times larger than it was in 2016. And there is a hunger to put these newly developed skills into practice: LinkedIn job posts that mention artificial intelligence or generative AI have seen 17 percent greater application growth over the past two years than job posts with no mentions of the technology. The leaders that focus on these skills when hiring (rather than just the degree someone has earned or jobs they’ve had) will unlock more potential and be more agile as the way we do work continues to change.\n\nThe same is true for developing talent. We will increasingly see employers become educators, “training to hire” into ever-changing jobs through onboardings, apprenticeships, and academies, as well as “training to promote” into ever-changing roles through upskilling and tours of duty that take employees into new functions and perhaps even new careers. This will be for hard skills related to AI, but perhaps more importantly, for people skills, too: Our data shows 92 percent of US executives believe people skills are more important than ever.\n\n2024 will start to usher in a new world of work where people skills—problem solving, empathy, and active listening to name just three—are more core to career success, and people-to-people collaboration is more core to company success. Leaders and employees need to think of AI as just one tool in the toolbox. It doesn’t replace people, it allows them to do their job more effectively, leaving them time to focus on the more valuable—and more human—parts of their jobs. For instance, a software engineer can have AI help with the more routine or repetitive coding that’s regularly required, giving them more time to innovate on new ideas. Or a recruiter can save time and focus on the more strategic parts of the hiring process—like speaking to and building relationships with candidates—by letting AI handle the creation of job postings.\n\nIn 2024, leaders will lean into this ever-evolving technology while simultaneously empowering their employees, and people will align their skill-building and continuing education with AI skills and practical people skills. The result will be a new world of work that’s more human and more fulfilling than ever before.",

    "content": "Can you imagine what a digital white ethnostate or a cyber caliphate might look like? Having spent most of my career on the inside of online extremist movements, I certainly can. The year 2024 might be the one in which neo-Nazis, jihadists, and conspiracy theorists turn their utopian visions of creating their own self-governed states into reality—not offline, but in the form of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).\n\nDAOs are digital entities that are collaboratively governed without central leadership and operate based on blockchain. They allow internet users to establish their own organizational structures, which no longer require the involvement of a third party in financial transactions and rulemaking. The World Economic Forum described DAOs as “an experiment to reimagine how we connect, collaborate and create”. However, as with all new technologies, there is also a darker side to them: They are likely to give rise to new threats emerging from decentralized extremist mobilization.\n\nToday, there are already over 10,000 DAOs, which collectively manage billions of dollars and count millions of participants. So far, DAOs have attracted a wild mix of libertarians, activists, pranksters, and hobbyists. Most DAOs I have come across in my research sound innocent and fun. Personally, my favorites include theCaféDAO, which aims “to replace Starbucks” (good luck with that!); the Doge DAO, which wants to “make the Doge meme the most recognizable piece of art in the world”; and the HairDAO, “a decentralized asset manager solving hair loss.” But some DAOs use a more radical tone. For example, the Redacted Club DAO, which is rife with alt-right codes and conspiracy myth references, claims to be a secret network with the aim of “slaying” the “evil Meta Lizard King.”\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nThe year 2024 might be one in which extremists start using DAOs strategically. Policies, legal contracts, and financial transactions that were traditionally the domain of governments, courts, and banks can be replaced with smart contracts, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and cryptocurrencies. The use of anonymous bitcoin wallets and non-transparent cryptocurrencies such as Monero is already widespread among extremists whose bank accounts have been frozen. A shift to entirely decentralized forms of self-governance is only one step away.\n\nBeyond practical reasons that encourage extremists to create their own self-governed structures, there is an ideological incentive too: their fundamental distrust in the establishment. If you believe that the deep state or the “global Jewish elites” control everything from governments and Big Tech to the global banking system, DAOs offer an appealing alternative. Conversations on far-right fringe platforms such as BitChute and Odysee reveal that there is much appetite for decentralized alternative forms of collaboration, communication, and crowdfunding.\n\nSo what happens if anti-minority groups establish their own digital worlds in which they impose their own governing mechanisms? What are the stakes if trolling armies start cooperating via DAOs to launch election interference campaigns? The activities of extremist DAOs could challenge the rule of law, pose a threat to minority groups, and disrupt institutions that are currently considered fundamental pillars of democratic systems. Another risk is that DAOs can serve as safe havens for extremist movements by enabling users to circumvent government regulation and security services monitoring activities. They might also allow extremists to find new ways to fundraise, plan, and plot radicalization campaigns or even attacks. While many governments have focused on developing legal frameworks to regulate AI, few have even recognized the existence of DAOs. Their looming exploitation for extremist and criminal purposes is something that has flown under the radar of global policymakers.\n\nTechnology expert Carl Miller, who has long warned of potential misuse of DAOs, told me that “even though DAOs behave like companies, they are not registered as legal entities.” There are only a few exceptions: The US states of Wyoming, Vermont, and Tennessee have passed laws to legally recognize DAOs. With no regulations in place to hold DAOs accountable for extremist or criminal activities, the big question for 2024 will be: How can we ensure the metaverse doesn’t give rise to digital white ethnostates or cyber caliphates?",

    "content": "In 2024, social media will get small.\n\nNot small in influence, of course. As the US weathers an election likely to be both divisive and often divorced from reality, social media will again be a battleground for public opinion and perception. But the platforms on which these conversations will take place will be smaller in scale, more diverse, and less connected to one another.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2016 election, Donald Trump discovered he could speak directly to an audience of tens of millions on Twitter. Thrown off the platform after the January 6 insurrection, Trump moved to the much smaller Truth Social, a network whose main selling point seemed to be his presence. Trump lost something precious when he was deplatformed: the ability to speak to the “big room”—a platform that reached a broad swath of the people interested in public affairs.\n\nBig-room spaces, like Twitter and Instagram, are continual battlegrounds for attention. They’re invaluable for activists, who want messages like #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter to reach new converts to the movement, and for influencers who build power and revenue by building audiences. But they are also inherently conflicted spaces, as people of different points of view spar over what types of speech are appropriate for the space.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nTrump is now speaking to a smaller room, but it’s one where virtually everyone who hears him agrees with him. He’s never going to be thrown off Truth Social, because his statements, no matter how inflammatory, are the raison d’être for the network.\n\nConsciously or not, other platforms are moving in the same direction. Elon Musk’s compulsive destruction of Twitter is turning it into a smaller room, a safe space for extremists that makes it unsafe for those who don’t share their views. Reddit, long one of the most exciting spaces for informed, topical conversations, is shedding users as it implements unpopular, Muskian policies in hopes of generating much-needed revenue. Some subreddits are migrating to Discord, where their conversations won’t overlap with thousands of other topics on Reddit, but where they have full control over their chosen rules of the road.\n\nSmall-room networks can be deeply important spaces for communities to find support and solidarity. When you seek support for living with diabetes or without alcohol (two struggles I’m personally engaged in), you’re not looking for confrontation, but for camaraderie, comfort, and constructive advice. Millions of us find these spaces in subreddits, Facebook groups, or even on special-purpose social networks, such as Archive of One’s Own, which links together 5 million fan-fiction authors and fans each month.\n\nBut small rooms have a big downside: They’re as useful for Nazis as they are for knitters. These conversations, insulated from outside scrutiny, can normalize extreme points of view and lead people deeper into dark topics they expressed a passing interest in.\n\nWe need small-room networks—they introduce strangers to one another, building social capital and connection between people who might never interact in the physical world. But they further fragment the public sphere, which means the 2024 election may be even more fractious than the ones we’ve seen thus far in our social media age.",

    "content": "Many years before ChatGPT was released, my research group, the University of Cambridge Social Decision-Making Laboratory, wondered whether it was possible to have neural networks generate misinformation. To achieve this, we trained ChatGPT’s predecessor, GPT-2, on examples of popular conspiracy theories and then asked it to generate fake news for us. It gave us thousands of misleading but plausible-sounding news stories. A few examples: “Certain Vaccines Are Loaded With Dangerous Chemicals and Toxins,” and “Government Officials Have Manipulated Stock Prices to Hide Scandals.” The question was, would anyone believe these claims?\n\nWe created the first psychometric tool to test this hypothesis, which we called the Misinformation Susceptibility Test (MIST). In collaboration with YouGov, we used the AI-generated headlines to test how susceptible Americans are to AI-generated fake news. The results were concerning: 41 percent of Americans incorrectly thought the vaccine headline was true, and 46 percent thought the government was manipulating the stock market. Another recent study, published in the journal Science, showed not only that GPT-3 produces more compelling disinformation than humans, but also that people cannot reliably distinguish between human and AI-generated misinformation.\n\nMy prediction for 2024 is that AI-generated misinformation will be coming to an election near you, and you likely won’t even realize it. In fact, you may have already been exposed to some examples. In May of 2023, a viral fake story about a bombing at the Pentagon was accompanied by an AI-generated image which showed a big cloud of smoke. This caused public uproar and even a dip in the stock market. Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis used fake images of Donald Trump hugging Anthony Fauci as part of his political campaign. By mixing real and AI-generated images, politicians can blur the lines between fact and fiction, and use AI to boost their political attacks.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nBefore the explosion of generative AI, cyber-propaganda firms around the world needed to write misleading messages themselves, and employ human troll factories to target people at-scale. With the assistance of AI, the process of generating misleading news headlines can be automated and weaponized with minimal human intervention. For example, micro-targeting—the practice of targeting people with messages based on digital trace data, such as their Facebook likes—was already a concern in past elections, despite its main obstacle being the need to generate hundreds of variants of the same message to see what works on a given group of people. What was once labor-intensive and expensive is now cheap and readily available with no barrier to entry. AI has effectively democratized the creation of disinformation: Anyone with access to a chatbot can now seed the model on a particular topic, whether it’s immigration, gun control, climate change, or LGBTQ+ issues, and generate dozens of highly convincing fake news stories in minutes. In fact, hundreds of AI-generated news sites are already popping up, propagating false stories and videos.\n\nTo test the impact of such AI-generated disinformation on people’s political preferences, researchers from the University of Amsterdam created a deepfake video of a politician offending his religious voter base. For example, in the video the politician joked: “As Christ would say, don’t crucify me for it.” The researchers found that religious Christian voters who watched the deepfake video had more negative attitudes toward the politician than those in the control group.\n\nIt is one thing to dupe people with AI-generated disinformation in experiments. It’s another to experiment with our democracy. In 2024, we will see more deepfakes, voice cloning, identity manipulation, and AI-produced fake news. Governments will seriously limit—if not ban—the use of AI in political campaigns. Because if they don’t, AI will undermine democratic elections.",

The report, which was published in the medical journal The Lancet, also showed that nearly half of the respondents said that such distress affected them daily, and three-quarters agreed with the statement that “the future is frightening.” This, and many other studies, show clearly that climate change is not just a threat to the environment that we inhabit. It also poses a very real threat to our emotional well-being.\n\nPsychologists have categorized these feelings of grief, distress, and worry about the current climate emergency—a common occurrence among youth today—under the label of “eco-anxiety.” According to the Climate Psychology Alliance, eco-anxiety is defined as the “heightened emotional, mental or somatic distress in response to dangerous changes in the climate system.” Eco-anxiety doesn’t just affect young people. It also affects researchers who work in climate and ecological science, burdened by the reality depicted by their findings, and it affects the most economically marginalized across the globe, who disproportionately bear the devastating impacts of climate breakdown.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nIn 2024, eco-anxiety will rise to become one of the leading causes of mental health problems. The reasons are obvious. Scientists estimate that the world is likely to breach safe levels of temperature rise above pre-industrial levels for the first time by 2027. In recent years, we’ve seen wildfires tear through Canada and Greece, and summer floods decimate regions in Pakistan that are home to nearly 33 million people. Studies have shown that those impacted by air pollution and rising temperatures are more likely to experience psychological distress.\n\nTo make matters worse, in the face of climate catastrophe, our political class is not offering strong leadership. The COP28 conference in Dubai will be headed by an oil and gas company executive. In the UK, the government is backtracking on its green commitments.\n\nFortunately, greater levels of eco-anxiety will also offer an avenue for tackling the climate crisis head-on. Caroline Hickman, a researcher on eco-anxiety from the University of Bath, cautions that the feelings of worry, grief, despair, and despondency associated with eco-anxiety should not be pathologized. After all, the cause of this mental distress is undeniably external. According to Hickman, anyone experiencing these emotions is displaying entirely natural and rational reactions to the climate crisis. Her suggestion? Harness eco-anxiety as a tool for good—as an emotion that can galvanize people to act in protection of our planet.\n\nThis is why, in 2024, we will also see more people around the world join the fight for climate justice and seek jobs that prioritize environmental sustainability. Campaigners will put increased pressure on fossil fuel industries and the governments that subsidize them to rapidly phase out the usage of polluting coal, oil, and gas. It’s now clear that not only are they the main culprits for the climate crisis, they are also responsible for the mental health crisis that is starting to affect most of us. Eco-anxiety is not something we will defeat with therapy—we will tackle it by taking action.",

    "content": "In 2024, there will be a paradigm shift in employee-employer power and trust dynamics. It’s part of a generational redesign of work from being like a game of Tetris to becoming like a game of Roblox.\n\nGrowing up, I spent countless hours playing Tetris on my Nintendo Game Boy. There was something mesmerizing about slotting the flat-sided blocks together that fell from above. The design of the game was clean, precise, and simple. It gave the player a sense of order and control. I showed my 12-year-old son Tetris and asked if he wanted to play. “Why would I?” he quickly replied. “You can never beat the system.” And, in this sense, he’s right.\n\nOrganizations by design used to be a lot like a game of Tetris—top-down, hierarchal, with clear rules. Work had fixed boundaries around hours, physical locations, and roles. Importantly, these boundaries were mostly set by the employer, not the employee.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nWhile I’m part of Generation Tetris (or Gen X), my son is very much a member of Generation Roblox (Gen Z). In his world, just like in the game of Roblox, there are endless possibilities of realms you can create and roles you can play. You can invent your dream job, build bridges or spaceships, take care of a farm, or live in a mansion on the waterfront. At its heart, Roblox is about self-authorship. But the feeling of control comes from being a creator, not organizing blocks. He loves Roblox because, in his words, “It’s my world and my rules.”\n\nThe world of Tetris and the world of Roblox are in many ways a powerful metaphor for a profound power and trust shift happening in the world of work. Gen Z (and Y and Alpha that will start to enter the workforce at the end of this decade) have little interest in a way of working designed like a game of Tetris. The rules, rewards, and reporting structures don't make any sense to them. Given that, by 2025, 27 percent of the workforce in OECD countries will be Gen Z, it’s a pressing problem to fix. By 2030, the Roblox generation will be the majority, with over 58 percent of the workforce made up of Gen Z and millennials.\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, almost two-thirds of Gen Z would prefer to work for themselves or a startup. 80 percent of Gen Z workers globally are looking to find a job that better aligns with their values. About half report they would quit their job if it interfered with their work-life balance. The solution proposed to these changing work dynamics is often flexibility. Yes, younger generations want or expect more flexibility, but focusing on where and when people work is missing a deeper paradigm shift—people’s relationship to organizations has been transformed.\n\nIn many ways, the design of Tetris reflected a “power over” way of thinking about leadership: “If I tell others what to do, they will follow.” You don’t get to invent rules and boundaries; they’re inherent in a linear, top-down system. Roblox, on the other hand, represents a “power with” dynamic. There are no corporate ladders to climb or hierarchies to navigate—unless you invent them. Engagement comes from the game design being collaborative, autonomous, personalized, and peer-driven.\n\nAccording to a recent report by Gartner, employee engagement has 3.8 times as much influence on employee stress as work location. In other words, how people experience their everyday work—their feelings of involvement and enthusiasm—matters more in reducing stress than where they are doing their work. Gaming designers understand this, but most organizations don’t. In 2024, leaders will have no alternative but to accept that you can no longer play Tetris in a Roblox world.\n\nWIRED has teamed up with Jobbio to create WIRED Hired, a dedicated career marketplace for WIRED readers.

    "content": "In 2024, the maternal mortality rate (MMR) in the United States and the United Kingdom will grow, although postmortem reviews conclude that 80 percent of maternal deaths in high-income countries are preventable. Rates in high-income countries across Western Europe and Asia did decrease between 1990 and 2010, yet in some of these countries, like the UK, MMRs have risen over the past decade. The US MMR has been an outlier throughout, almost doubling in the first decades of the 21st century.\n\nReasons to support the prediction that MMRs will go up include the continuing consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, MMR increases in the US and UK predated Covid, suggesting the pandemic exacerbated deeper problems.\n\nNeglect and systematic bias in medical care systems is one of them. In the US, critical challenges to improvement include the lack of universal health insurance and the increasingly competitive health care system: The US has hemorrhaged maternity care providers to the point that 36 percent of US counties, mostly rural, have none. In the UK, health care is theoretically available to all, yet the NHS has suffered insufficient investment in its facilities and equipment. Half of NHS Maternity Units are now judged substandard; shortages of midwives have hit crisis proportions. Obstetricians and midwives in both countries are suffering burnout and choosing to strike, practice abroad, retire, or change profession.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nRacial and class inequity is entrenched. The highest MMRs and largest increases are in minoritized, working class, or deprived populations. Devastating as inadequate health care systems are for these groups, the fundamental causes of their health inequities are adverse living conditions, including the stigma and discrimination they face. Robust scientific evidence that the multiple systemic assaults with which they must contend in their daily round—material hardship, environmental toxicity, decaying municipal infrastructure, and structurally rooted psychosocial stressors—chronically activate their human physiological stress response.\n\nCombined, the stressors and the tenacious coping they entail cumulatively damage health down to the cellular level, in effect accelerating biological aging. Such erosion, called “weathering,” leaves the marginalized, maligned, or exploited to suffer multiple infectious and chronic diseases, functional limitations, and even death, long before they are chronologically old. In populations subject to the most severe weathering, the increasing trend of having children at older ages increases the risk of adverse maternal and infant outcomes. Maternal mortality is a barometer of weathering’s contribution to excess deaths, as the physical stress of pregnancy is harder to withstand for a weathered body, while other manifestations of weathering often become life-threatening only after the reproductive ages.\n\nIn 2024, weathering will keep being fueled by racism, classism, xenophobia, political polarization, resentment, white nationalism, and austerity budgeting. Brexit, one outgrowth of this resentment, now exacerbates UK labor shortages, supply-chain bottlenecks, inflation, and a reduced gross domestic product. Neither the US nor Western Europe fully embrace their minority or immigrant populations.\n\nIn 2024, this problem will intensify as wars and climate change increase the flow of immigrants of color. Despite the facts, the official stance of the UK Equalities Minister is dismissive of systemic racism as a cause of health inequality. The 2021 Report by the UK Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities turns to an unsubstantiated victim-blaming shibboleth, inferring that inequity stems from the failure of minoritized populations to exercise agency and take advantage of apparently abundant health-promoting opportunities. In the politically polarized US, active and influential populist movements seek to whitewash American history.\n\nIn 2024, countermovements to take racist and classist history seriously will continue to run up against strong undercurrents of political scapegoating and zero-sum thinking throughout both countries, increasing the severity and reach of weathering.",

    "content": "The platform is the canonical form of internet business: a two-sided market that facilitates connections between end-users and business customers. Uber connects drivers with riders; Amazon and eBay connect sellers with buyers; TikTok and YouTube connect performers with audiences; social media connects people with something to say with people who want to hear it.\n\nAnd yet, lax competition law has allowed companies to consolidate, cornering their markets. Consolidated sectors, meanwhile, find it easy to sing with one voice, blocking the passage of unfavorable regulation (there's still no US national privacy law) or its enforcement (the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation shows that Ireland is even more valuable as a lawless regulation haven than it ever was as a mere tax haven).\n\nUndisciplined by competition or regulation, platforms are free to slide into “enshittification,” in which the company extracts value from both sides of the two-sided market, relying on lock-in to keep users and business customers from defecting to a rival. The year 2023 was when the platforms soured: Twitch, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Google Search, and Discord all spiraled into terminal enshittification, transferring value from users to shareholders, leaving behind shambling half-dead things that were disagreeable, but un-quittable.\n\nThe secret to that un-quittability is high “switching costs”—the economists’ term for the things you have to give up to leave a service. You hate Facebook, but you love connecting with your communities, friends, and customers. They’re holding you hostage on Facebook’s behalf—and you’re holding them hostage, too. Facebook literally banks on these high switching costs: The US Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust case against Facebook revealed internal memos in which a product manager explicitly sets out to design features that “make switching costs very high for users” in order to make it “very tough for a user to switch” to a rival service.\n\nRegulators are increasingly alive to the fact that Big Tech deliberately designs its products to impose high costs on users who have the temerity to prefer their competitors. If a company fails to offer official means for users to take their data with them, or to continue to communicate with the contacts they leave behind when they change platforms, those users have little recourse. The once-common practice of reverse-engineering a rival platform to make an unofficial, interoperable bridge—say, a tool that scrapes your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other messages for a common inbox on a new, privacy-respecting service—have been effectively outlawed by anti-circumvention laws, patents, copyrights, and exotic contract theories like “tortious interference.”\n\nDespite these barriers to exit that keep users tethered to bad platforms, most of the regulatory response to Big Tech has been aimed at making it better, rather than making it easier to leave. We keep making rules obliging Big Tech to police disinformation, harassment, and a host of other evils, but with the passage of the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), we’re finally focusing on making Big Tech less important to its users, and thus less sticky.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nThe DMA lets the commission draft per-service rules to facilitate “interoperability”—connectivity—with new services. This isn’t mere data portability, or downloading a blob containing all the messages you've sent and the photos you uploaded. It’s the ability to leave a service, set up elsewhere, and resume the conversations and transactions you left behind. For example, under the DMA, it should be possible to leave Facebook and set up on a community-run Mastodon server, and continue to participate in group discussions and exchange individual messages with the people who aren’t ready to leave (yet).\n\nIn the UK, the long-overdue Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill finally gives enforcement powers to the Digital Markets Unit at the Competition and Markets Authority, which has dozens of smart engineers and policy people on HMG’s payroll, all champing at the bit to turn their detailed market studies into policy. If the bill passes, they'll have broad latitude to fashion remedies for each dominant service, including interoperability mandates obliging walled gardens to install gateways for new market entrants, making it easy for users to leave without isolating themselves from important social relationships.\n\nIn the US, multiple interoperability bills with broad bipartisan support have made it out of committee, only to be denied a vote after intense lobbying by the tech sector. But if the UK and EU impose interoperability on tech firms, it won’t matter whether America’s captured legislature can't manage to add its own—users all over the world will get the benefits of interop and its incineration of switching costs.\n\nThese remedies will start to come online in 2024. I believe we will see one or more of the Big Tech platforms facing a legal requirement to facilitate their users’ departure: “Mr. Zuckerberg, tear down that wall(ed garden).”",

    "content": "Every November, the Global Carbon Project publishes the year’s global CO 2 emissions. It’s never good news. At a time when the world needs to be reducing emissions, the numbers continue to climb. However, while emissions have been moving in the wrong direction, many of the underpinning economic forces that drive them have been going the right way. This could well be the year when these various forces push hard enough to finally tip the balance.\n\nIn 2022, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said it expected global energy emissions to hit their peak by 2025. This estimate marked a big change from the year before, sparked by accelerated investments in low-carbon technologies following the war in Ukraine. Rystad Energy—another research and analysis group—also expects a peak by 2025. Ember Climate—the leading source on global electricity data—estimates that emissions from global electricity already peaked in 2022. Analysts might disagree on the exact date, but it’s clear that a peak in emissions is now well within our grasp.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nThe world is already steadily decarbonizing its electricity. Solar and wind are growing quickly, and in 2024 these two sources of renewable energy could outstrip the increase in electricity demand. If this happens, coal- and gas-burning will go down, and so will emissions.\n\nUnsurprisingly, when we actually reach peak emissions will depend a lot on the world’s largest emitter, China. In 2023 its emissions were still rising. This is partly due to its continued recovery from Covid-19. An ongoing drought also means its hydropower output has dropped. These factors highlight, again, how difficult these things are to predict: One unexpected event can always flip a peak into another record-breaking year.\n\nChina’s peak, however, is going to come soon, because of record-high deployments of solar and wind, and an increase in nuclear power. Soon, the country will be adding enough sustainable energy to cover its growing electricity demand. China’s solar and wind output is already enough to cover the total electricity use of some of the world’s largest economies like Canada, Brazil, Russia, Japan, and even the world’s most populous country, India. In 2023 alone it could add enough to cover the UK’s entire electricity use.\n\nAnother reason why the peak in global emissions might arrive in 2024 is the electric car revolution. Global sales of petrol and diesel cars peaked half a decade ago, and the IEA estimated that almost one in five cars sold globally in 2023 were electric. Previously, the agency hadn’t expected this milestone to be reached until 2030. (In 2020, this figure was just 4 percent.) This move to EVs will start to eat into global oil demand, until its peak arrives too. According to a report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, this could be as early as 2027.\n\nOf course, peaking emissions is just the start. The world needs to then reduce emissions, and quickly. But the downslope will be easier than the turning point, as the energy transition will no longer be in its infancy. 2024 will hopefully mark the beginning of a mature low-carbon global economy.",

    "content": "Earlier this year, Parkinson’s disease (PD) research entered a new era when the Michael J. Fox Foundation announced a momentous scientific breakthrough—the discovery of a biomarker for PD. It meant that, for the first time ever, we can now pinpoint the earliest known signs of the disease in Parkinson’s patients.\n\nThis long-awaited new procedure is called the “alpha-synuclein seeding amplification assay” (SAA), and it’s capable of detecting the misfolded alpha-synuclein in spinal fluid—the wayward protein clearly linked to Parkinson’s. It separates, with a stunning 90 percent specificity, those who have evidence of PD pathology in their cells from those who do not. It does so even before the emergence of symptoms, much like the way high blood pressure or cholesterol levels are used to detect cardiovascular risk long before a heart attack lands someone in the ER.\n\nIt would be hard to overstate the implications of this development for people living with dysfunction in their alpha-synuclein. For one thing, we’ve never had a way to know who these people are—that is, until the moment of diagnosis, by which point ongoing damage to brain cells is already well underway. As for the diagnosis itself, which for most people comes as a bolt from the blue, it has always been frustratingly subjective and essentially based on a physician’s opinion following a brief once-over in the doctor’s office—not very useful for medical care provision, let alone biomedical drug development.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nThe new SAA test is already being integrated into drug trials as the first measure that can objectively identify people with the biology we’re targeting—offering drugmakers increased assurance that they are testing experimental treatments in the right populations. For biopharma firms weighing a decision to enter or stay in the high-risk neurological disease space, this changes the value proposition of investment on its face. In 2024, we will see a ramp-up of potential new drugs entering the pipeline and progressing along their path toward pharmacy shelves.\n\nWhat’s just as remarkable is how the SAA breakthrough was arrived at. The search for the biomarker required finding and studying “needles in a haystack”: people without any traditional symptoms of PD and unwittingly living with increased risk for the disease. It was critical to figure out what biology set them apart from those who don’t get Parkinson’s. But how do you find someone who doesn’t know they’re being looked for?\n\nAs it turns out, your sense of smell is a surprisingly good predictor of brain disease. (We’re talking here not about the short-term smell loss associated with Covid-19, but significant and enduring smell loss that persists over years.) For a while now, researchers have known about the link between smell loss and neurodegeneration, especially in the presence of certain other risk factors, such as a diagnosis with REM behavior disorder (RBD), a sleep disorder. Research shows that half of those over age 60 are living with some degree of smell loss, yet the majority don’t realize it until they’re tested. If you couple this with the fact that all major brain diseases—Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, ALS, Huntington’s—are associated with some amount of smell loss, this is astounding.\n\nThe Michael J. Fox Foundation’s large-scale observational study of Parkinson’s set out to use poor smell as one of its criteria for finding and enrolling at-risk individuals. (We should note that, for this risk group, it’s still unclear if or when the disease may eventually show up.) The highly sophisticated screening device used? A humble scratch-and-sniff test, albeit the scientifically validated variety.\n\nUntil the SAA biomarker was validated, a reduced sense of smell couldn’t be objectively linked to the presence of underlying Parkinson’s disease biology. But now we can report that the test accurately diagnosed disease in 99 percent of people with poor smell and so-called sporadic Parkinson’s (in other words, those with no genetic mutation).\n\nIn 2024, we will begin to see a sea change in the possibilities around screening for and predicting PD and, very possibly, other diseases of aging. An annual scratch-and-sniff test may soon become as commonplace as your mammogram or colonoscopy. In 2024, with widespread adoption, this simple, cheap, and accessible mechanism will radically alter the landscape of what’s possible in Parkinson’s research and care.",

    "content": "In 2024, I will walk into a physical space—a restaurant, a hairdresser, an arts venue, an artisanal cheese shop—and instead of being handed a physical piece of paper with some useful information on it, or being told it in words, I will be shown a faded roundel with a QR code on it. I will hold my phone’s camera up to it wearily. Sometimes it will work, but the font on the menu or the information will be small. I’ll have to enlarge it and take my glasses off to read it, because I’ve reached that age. Sometimes it won’t work at all. Sometimes the information on it will be out of date.\n\nIn all cases, many people—some elderly, others with access needs, children, anyone who just doesn’t fancy constantly looking at their phone—will be pushed toward more useless screen time and away from the kind of brief, friendly interactions with other humans that help us all feel part of the fabric of life. We’ll have reached the point of overdigitization.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nIt's not that there aren’t more gains to be made in technology. Incredible things are happening in biotech, especially since the pandemic. The world of continuous glucose monitors and lateral flow tests (LFT) will keep growing. In 2024 we will see new kinds of LFTs that test for other infections and problems. We will see more useful work in truly personalized medicine. But in the UK, at least, the benefit of those innovations will be increasingly available only for those who can pay for it themselves. The division between the technological haves and have-nots will only continue to grow.\n\nAnd although technology will continue to flourish, my guess is that the truly big gains in digital communication have now been made for a generation. If there’s innovation to come in digital communication it will be in the field of overdigitization, using screens where paper and actual words from real people both work better. We could—and should—use this next decade to shore up the gains we’ve made for all members of society. But I predict that, in 2024, we won’t. The Good Things Foundation estimates that 10 million people in the UK lack the basic digital skills needed to access the modern world. And 6.9 million people will continue to be excluded if they’re not given proactive help. But the current British government doesn’t seem much interested in raising the floor for the worst off.\n\nThese things can’t be done by individual companies, which come up with good-sounding ideas like, “why don’t we let people order a coffee while they’re getting their hair done, using a QR code!” It’s exactly the kind of things that incorrigibly urban WIRED readers like me think would be fun to use—but companies don’t tend to think about how to help people who aren’t going to spend money with them, or who are too put off by over-exuberant digital-everywhere to actually go into the shop.\n\nCompanies can look after their employees. And they can work to overcome that other half of the overdigitization problem: that many jobs are becoming more boring and isolated because they involve the equivalents of more pointing-at-QR-code-roundels and less actual interaction with people. But while companies can think about employees and about good customer service, thinking about improving equality and fairness is the job of government, not businesses.\n\nThere is of course one thing I can predict with total certainty for the UK in 2024: That the British public will get to have their own say on digital inequality and a whole host of other issues. Because, in 2024, Parliament will be dissolved in advance of an election.",

    "content": "“It might be the best time for any kind of business in any industry to raise money for all of history, like since the time of the ancient Egyptians,” an excitable Stuart Butterfield, CEO of Slack, told Farhad Manjoo in The New York Times in 2015.\n\nThis was no exaggeration. While interest rates remained close to zero, venture capital funds raised more money than ever and exited their investments at some of the highest valuations ever witnessed.\n\nThe glory days of VC are over, and if history is any guide, the tech bust should last through 2024 and beyond. In other words, the venture capital bust has only just started.\n\nUltralow interest rates benefited venture capital in a number of ways. Low yields on conventional investments lured investors to Silicon Valley, which promised outsized returns. Between 2016 and 2021, US venture capital investment tripled. Ultralow rates compress the dimension of time, making the future appear closer than it is. It's not surprising, therefore, that a large number of wildly extravagant startups got financed—luxury space travel, flying taxis, autonomous vehicles, and so forth. Due diligence took a back seat. Sam Bankman-Fried’s failed crypto-exchange, FTX, attracted a roster of blue-chip investors, led by Silicon Valley luminary Sequoia Capital.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nThe valuations of startups, whose profits lay in the distant future, were vastly inflated by easy money. After battery developer QuantumScape merged with a SPAC in 2020, its market cap exceeded General Motors’—even though the company expected no sales for many years. Easy money also fueled market liquidity, helping venture capitalists exit their investments. Never before were so many unprofitable companies floated at such high valuations. In 2021, more than a thousand IPOs came to the US markets, more than double the previous record.\n\nThe punch bowl was removed from the VC party after the Fed started to raise interest rates in 2022. QuantumScape’s stock is down more than 90 percent—but at least, unlike many other startups, it’s still in business. Bankman-Fried is in jail, awaiting trial. The IPO market has dried up. New entrants into the VC world have run for the hills. Others face large capital calls from VC funds they committed to during good times. Starved of fresh funds, many startups face a bleak future. WeWork, which grandly describes itself as an “office solutions company” (sounds better than “rentals”) and once sported a valuation of close to $50 billion, is the latest to hit the skids.\n\nThe Nasdaq index of technology stocks rebounded strongly in the first half of 2023. There’s huge excitement around artificial intelligence—NVIDIA, whose graphic processing units are used for AI, is valued at more than a trillion dollars. Great speculative bubbles, however, take years to unwind. Bear market rebounds, otherwise known as “sucker’s rallies,” are commonplace. After the dotcom bust, it took the Nasdaq a year and a half to trough (and more than 15 years to regain its peak). The IPO market saw little action for years.\n\nThe bear market in tech stocks is likely to return in 2024, with the Nasdaq index set to hit a new multiyear low. More startups will go bust, and venture capital funds will continue to post negative returns. As for Nvidia, it’s worth recalling what happened to Cisco Systems. During the dotcom bubble, Cisco, whose servers powered the internet, was briefly the world’s most valuable company. Its stock traded at nearly 40 times sales before crashing. More than two decades later, Cisco’s share price remains well below the bubble peak. Valued at around 35 times sales, Nvidia could well suffer a similar fate.",

    "content": "In 2024, we will see courts and regulators around the world demonstrate that tech exceptionalism, when it comes to the applicability of legal rules, is magical thinking. The tide has already started to turn on the assumption that law and regulation cannot keep up with technological innovation. But, in 2024, the sea change will come: not through new rules, but by old rules being applied aggressively to new problems.\n\nIn the United States, in the absence of federal privacy legislation, regulators have already started to repurpose laws and rules they do have at their disposal to address some of the most egregious examples of Big Tech playing fast and loose with our rights and personal data. In 2023, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) continued to expand the regulatory heft of consumer protection regulations.\n\nIt took on the problem of dark patterns—deceptive design used by apps and websites to trick users into doing something that they didn’t intend to, like buying or subscribing to something—with a half-billion-dollar fine against Fortnite maker Epic Games. The FTC also issued massive fines to Amazon for significant breaches of privacy through Alexa and Ring doorbell devices. There are no signs that, in 2024, the FTC will slow down, with rules in the pipeline to govern commercial surveillance and digital security. In 2024, we’ll see regulators in other fields and other parts of the world follow suit, bolstered by the FTC’s successes.\n\nIn 2022, the French Data Protection Authority, the CNIL, fined Clearview AI a record €20 million (around $21.9 million) for failure to comply with an earlier 2021 ruling, which had ordered the company to stop collecting and using data of persons on French territory. Further overdue penalties will be racking up in the millions of euros in 2023. In 2024, we will see regulators such as the CNIL taking more radical legal steps to show that no company is above the law.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nOpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, started 2023 with a call for global AI regulation, but balked at the actual prospect of EU regulation in the shape of the EU AI Act. While AI doomers asked for a pause on innovation to allow regulation to catch up, regulators including the Italian DPA found ways to clip their wings by stopping ChatGPT on their territory, albeit temporarily, with existing regulations. Ongoing intellectual property lawsuits, such as the one against Microsoft which charges the company to have illegally used code created by others, may well result in a turbulent 2024 for the fundamental business model of generative AI.\n\nIt is not only the individual impacts of technology that courts and regulators have in their sights. In 2024, they will also be considering the impacts on society, markets, and businesses. For instance, antitrust actions in the US and the EU launched in 2023 call into question Google’s dominance in the ad tech market, potentially shaking the monolithic logic of the programmatic advertising model that has helped create the internet as we know it today.\n\nIn 2024, we will see the regulatory void long enjoyed by Big Tech come to an end. While new laws and regulations like the AI Act, the Digital Services Act, and the Digital Markets Act in the EU start to take shape, courts and regulators will continue to apply existing law and regulation to the new ways that technology affects our daily lives. We will see the full panoply of legal tools coming to meet the challenges. Human rights and civil liberties law, competition law, consumer rights law, intellectual property, defamation, tort, employment law, and a plethora of other fields will be engaged to tackle the real-life harms already being caused by existing technology, including AI.",

    "content": "The ocean is Earth’s defining feature. Two of the most famous photographs of all time stamped that indelibly on our minds: Earthrise (1968) and The Blue Marble (1972), both taken during the Apollo missions to the moon. Once you have seen our fragile blue planet hanging in space, you can’t unsee it.\n\nThe ocean is an engine driven by sunlight, one that shifts and swirls as it carries energy, nutrients, and life around the planet in intricate patterns both large and small. The way it turns affects all our lives. It’s not a coincidence that Iceland happens to have rich fishing grounds, or that Britain is randomly warmer than Canada at the same latitude, or that luck of the draw means that the North Sea is green rather than blue.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nThese are all direct consequences of the way the ocean engine turns. Until now, the submerged workings of this giant machine have been hard to see and appreciate. In 2024, that will change.\n\nFor instance, the EU is currently building the first dynamic and interactive digital model of the entire ocean—a digital twin—which integrates knowledge from all branches of oceanography, including data from buoys, autonomous marine craft, satellites, and high-performance computational models. In 2024, this digital twin of the ocean will become operational. This will be publicly available to policymakers, businesses, and the public to help prioritize funds, make conservation decisions, and decide on how and where to deploy new marine infrastructure. The complex interactions of the ocean will become accessible in an entirely new way.\n\nOur attitude toward the ocean will also change. Historically, we’ve used it both as a universal rubbish dump (a place where we can supposedly discharge things without consequence) and as a universal resource (somewhere that is endlessly exploitable). Now that the damage this has done to the ocean is clear, we are starting to see ourselves as stewards of this engine and its life, both because it’s valuable and because we absolutely depend on it.\n\nIn 2024, a UN Global Plastics Treaty will be agreed upon, which will include a road map for controlling plastic use and waste, and a framework for reducing the plastic pollution that ends up in the ocean. Also in 2024, the second stage of an EU Action Plan for the oceans will kick in, forcing a change in rules for bottom fishing and fishing gear to specifically protect species such as common skate, guitarfish, great white shark, sturgeons, and turtles.\n\nMost importantly, our perception of ourselves will once again change. In 2024, the Artemis 2 mission will be the first crewed mission to return to the moon since 1972, taking humans around it, but not landing. For the first time since the Blue Marble photograph was taken, human eyes will once again be far enough away to see our blue planet in all its glory against the emptiness of space. And this time, when the photos are shared with the world, we will be able to see who we really are: citizens of a planet whose beating heart is its ocean.",

    "content": "In the decades to come, 2023 may be remembered as the year of generative AI hype, where ChatGPT became arguably the fastest-spreading new technology in human history and expectations of AI-powered riches became commonplace. The year 2024 will be the time for recalibrating expectations.\n\nOf course, generative AI is an impressive technology, and it provides tremendous opportunities for improving productivity in a number of tasks. But because the hype has gone so far ahead of reality, the setbacks of the technology in 2024 will be more memorable.\n\nMore and more evidence will emerge that generative AI and large language models provide false information and are prone to hallucination—where an AI simply makes stuff up, and gets it wrong. Hopes of a quick fix to the hallucination problem via supervised learning, where these models are taught to stay away from questionable sources or statements, will prove optimistic at best. Because the architecture of these models is based on predicting the next word or words in a sequence, it will prove exceedingly difficult to have the predictions be anchored to known truths.\n\nAnticipation that there will be exponential improvements in productivity across the economy, or the much-vaunted first steps towards “artificial general intelligence”, or AGI, will fare no better. The tune on productivity improvements will shift to blaming failures on faulty implementation of generative AI by businesses. We may start moving towards the (much more meaningful) conclusion that one needs to know which human tasks can be augmented by these models, and what types of additional training workers need to make this a reality.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nSome people will start recognizing that it was always a pipe dream to reach anything resembling complex human cognition on the basis of predicting words. Others will say that intelligence is just around the corner. Many more, I fear, will continue to talk of the “existential risks” of AI, missing what is going wrong, as well as the much more mundane (and consequential) risks that its uncontrolled rollout is posing for jobs, inequality, and democracy.\n\nWe will witness these costs more clearly in 2024. Generative AI will have been adopted by many companies, but it will prove to be just “so-so automation” of the type that displaces workers but fails to deliver huge productivity improvements.\n\nThe biggest use of ChatGPT and other large language models will be in social media and online search. Platforms will continue to monetize the information they collect via individualized digital ads, while competition for user attention will intensify. The amount of manipulation and misinformation online will grow. Generative AI will then increase the amount of time people spend using screens (and the inevitable mental health problems associated with it).\n\nThere will be more AI startups, and the open source model will gain some traction, but this will not be enough to halt the emergence of a duopoly in the industry, with Google and Microsoft/OpenAI dominating the field with their gargantuan models. Many more companies will be compelled to rely on these foundation models to develop their own apps. And because these models will continue to disappoint due to false information and hallucinations, many of these apps will also disappoint.\n\nCalls for antitrust and regulation will intensify. Antitrust action will go nowhere, because neither the courts nor policymakers will have the courage to attempt to break up the largest tech companies. There will be more stirrings in the regulation space. Nevertheless, meaningful regulation will not arrive in 2024, for the simple reason that the US government has fallen so far behind the technology that it needs some time to catch up—a shortcoming that will become more apparent in 2024, intensifying discussions around new laws and regulations, and even becoming more bipartisan.",

    "content": "Until now, AI systems have been largely designed to be algorithm-based and focused on input and output. But there is a conversation going on in both the digital technology and education sectors about the positive value of multidisciplinary design, and the importance of outcomes beyond revenue maximization and scaled efficiency.\n\nIn 2024, creativity will drive innovation in AI. Until now AI has curated things, but the release of new generative tools offers enormous opportunities for creators. Guided by creative technologists and leaders on both sides of the creative-tech divide, AI in 2024 will be thoughtful, more inclusive, and impact-led. Contrary to the belief that AI systems stifle creativity, this will catalyze inventiveness in corporations and academia. Here's what we can expect:\n\nThe Renaissance humanist and polymath Leonardo da Vinci is the poster child for multidisciplinary innovation: painter, draftsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor, and architect, his work spanned anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and paleontology. In today’s era of intelligence, the field of human-centered speculative design—which investigates the nexus between science, technology, and humans—will go through its own renaissance in the tech industry.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nSpeculative designers, creative technologists, and computational designers working with AI, hybrid, and mixed realities will be reshaping the very digital tools they have been using. They place less value on the product and more on the process and considerations around responsible and ethical AI.\n\nIn 2024, liberal arts universities will double down on programs which will, through research, new courses, and knowledge exchange, enable creatives to leverage code as a tool and AI as the material they shape. Core institutions include Stanford’s Human-Centered AI Lab and University of the Arts London’s Creative Computing Institute, established in 2020 at the intersection of creativity and computational technologies, where academics explore critical frameworks in decolonization, decarbonization, and issues of social justice.\n\nWe will see initiatives in creative and ethical technologies from Big Tech, and investment in sandboxes and incubators similar to the platform I founded, Open-Ended, looking at generative AI and large language models across the emerging technology spectrum.\n\nGoogle's creative tech-led AI team, Mural, is part of its machine learning research umbrella. Mural channels speculative design to consider how AI can benefit society and the planet to “question, provoke … and explore alternative imaginaries for AI,” and bring these back to Google’s core AI research. In 2024, Mural will partner with the University of Applied Arts in Vienna to engage AI with postindustrial and speculative design, led by lecturer Anab Jain.\n\nBy 2030, $134 billion will have been invested in immersive technologies, with a need for new content and ideas. We will see research-driven creative collaborations with robotics, gaming, and digital platforms. Artists who explore human and machine intelligence will propose a reconsideration of the formula-based concept of “intelligence” which is built into AI systems, to include creative intelligence, empathy, the intelligence of other species, as well as the wisdom of Indigenous cultures.\n\nSuch creatives are growing in number and influence. Polymathic choreographer Wayne McGregor is launching a project with Niantic in 2024 on the concept of “embodied physical intelligence.” Artists such as Es Devlin and Refik Anadol fuse art, science, and tech in interrogating and leveraging AI systems; they showcase their practice virtually and across the world, from the Museum of Modern Art to the World Economic Forum and UN General Assembly.\n\nIn 2024, how we design for AI will not be standalone. It will be woven into global issues: economic inequality, culture and creativity, geopolitics, the future of food, energy independence, and climate change. In the vein of the speculative design model, there is no need for clear “solutions”: There is a need for prioritizing creativity, humanity, and ecology.",

    "content": "In April 2022, when Dall-E, a text-to-image visio-linguistic model, was released, it purportedly attracted over a million users within the first three months. This was followed by ChatGPT, in January 2023, which apparently reached 100 million monthly active users just two months after launch. Both mark notable moments in the development of generative AI, which in turn has brought forth an explosion of AI-generated content into the web. The bad news is that, in 2024, this means we will also see an explosion of fabricated, nonsensical information, mis- and disinformation, and the exacerbation of social negative stereotypes encoded in these AI models.\n\nThe AI revolution wasn’t spurred by any recent theoretical breakthrough—indeed, most of the foundational work underlying artificial neural networks has been around for decades—but by the “availability” of massive data sets. Ideally, an AI model captures a given phenomena—be it human language, cognition, or the visual world—in a way that is representative of the real phenomena as closely as possible.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nFor example, for a large language model (LLM) to generate humanlike text, it is important the model is fed huge volumes of data that somehow represents human language, interaction, and communication. The belief is that the larger the data set, the better it captures human affairs, in all their inherent beauty, ugliness, and even cruelty. We are in an era that is marked by an obsession to scale up models, data sets, and GPUs. Current LLMs, for instance, have now entered an era of trillion-parameter machine-learning models, which means that they require billion-sized data sets. Where can we find it? On the web.\n\nThis web-sourced data is assumed to capture “ground truth” for human communication and interaction, a proxy from which language can be modeled on. Although various researchers have now shown that online data sets are often of poor quality, tend to exacerbate negative stereotypes, and contain problematic content such as racial slurs and hateful speech, often towards marginalized groups, this hasn’t stopped the big AI companies from using such data in the race to scale up.\n\nWith generative AI, this problem is about to get a lot worse. Rather than representing the social world from input data in an objective way, these models encode and amplify social stereotypes. Indeed, recent work shows that generative models encode and reproduce racist and discriminatory attitudes toward historically marginalized identities, cultures, and languages.\n\nIt is difficult, if not impossible—even with state-of-the-art detection tools—to know for sure how much text, image, audio, and video data is being generated currently and at what pace. Stanford University researchers Hans Hanley and Zakir Durumeric estimate a 68 percent increase in the number of synthetic articles posted to Reddit and a 131 percent increase in misinformation news articles between January 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023. Boomy, an online music generator company, claims to have generated 14.5 million songs (or 14 percent of recorded music) so far. In 2021, Nvidia predicted that, by 2030, there will be more synthetic data than real data in AI models. One thing is for sure: The web is being deluged by synthetically generated data.\n\nThe worrying thing is that these vast quantities of generative AI outputs will, in turn, be used as training material for future generative AI models. As a result, in 2024, a very significant part of the training material for generative models will be synthetic data produced from generative models. Soon, we will be trapped in a recursive loop where we will be training AI models using only synthetic data produced by AI models. Most of this will be contaminated with stereotypes that will continue to amplify historical and societal inequities. Unfortunately, this will also be the data that we will use to train generative models applied to high-stake sectors including medicine, therapy, education, and law. We have yet to grapple with the disastrous consequences of this. By 2024, the generative AI explosion of content that we find so fascinating now will instead become a massive toxic dump that will come back to bite us.",

    "content": "For researchers, social media has always represented greater access to data, more democratic involvement in knowledge production, and great transparency about social behavior. Getting a sense of what was happening—especially during political crises, major media events, or natural disasters—was as easy as looking around a platform like Twitter or Facebook. In 2024, however, that will no longer be possible.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nIn 2024, we will face a grim digital dark age, as social media platforms transition away from the logic of Web 2.0 and toward one dictated by AI-generated content. Companies have rushed to incorporate large language models (LLMs) into online services, complete with hallucinations (inaccurate, unjustified responses) and mistakes, which have further fractured our trust in online information.\n\nAnother aspect of this new digital dark age comes from not being able to see what others are doing. Twitter once pulsed with publicly readable sentiment of its users. Social researchers loved Twitter data, relying on it because it provided a ready, reasonable approximation of how a significant slice of internet users behaved. However, Elon Musk has now priced researchers out of Twitter data after recently announcing that it was ending free access to the platform’s API. This made it difficult, if not impossible, to obtain data needed for research on topics such as public health, natural disaster response, political campaigning, and economic activity. It was a harsh reminder that the modern internet has never been free or democratic, but instead walled and controlled.\n\nCloser cooperation with platform companies is not the answer. X, for instance, has filed a suit against independent researchers who pointed out the rise in hate speech on the platform. Recently, it has also been revealed that researchers who used Facebook and Instagram’s data to study the platforms’ role in the US 2020 elections had been granted “independence by permission” by Meta. This means that the company chooses which projects to share its data with and, while the research may be independent, Meta also controls what types of questions are asked and who asks them.\n\nWith elections coming in the US, India, Mexico, Indonesia, the UK, and the EU in 2024, the stakes are high. Until now, online “observatories” have been independently monitoring social media platforms for evidence of manipulation, inauthentic behavior, and harmful content. However, changes in data access by social media platforms, as well as the explosion of generative AI misinformation, means that the tools that researchers and journalists developed in prior national elections for monitoring online activity won’t work. One of my own collaborations, AI4TRUST, is developing new tools for combating misinformation, but our endeavor is stalled because of these changes.\n\nWe need to clean up our online platforms. The Center for Countering Digital Hate, a research, advocacy, and policy organization working to stop the spread of online hate and disinformation, has called for the adoption of its STAR Framework (Safety by Design, Transparency, Accountability, and Responsibility). This would ensure that digital products and services are safe before they are launched; increase transparency around algorithms, rule enforcement, and advertising; and work to hold companies both accountable to democratic and independent bodies, and responsible for omissions and actions that lead to harm. The EU’s Digital Services Act is a step in the right direction of regulation, including provisions to ensure that independent researchers can monitor social network platforms. However, these provisions will take years to be actionable. The UK’s Online Safety Bill—slowly making its way through the policy process—could also help, but again, these provisions will take time to implement. Until then, the transition from social media to AI-mediated information means that, in 2024, a new digital dark age will likely begin.",

That’s why movies directed by women are so refreshing—they come from a perspective that we rarely get to see on the silver screen.\nWomen have been helping shape the world of cinema since its early days, and the last couple of decades have seen some real momentum, with strong women directors delivering some groundbreaking work. Here, then, is our list of some of the best women-directed films you can stream on\nNetflix\nright now.\n8\nWayne’s World\nRelease Year\n1992\nDirector\nPenelope Spheeris\nRuntime\n1 hour, 35 minutes\nWayne’s World\nis one of the best movies to ever come from a\nSaturday Night Live\nsketch. The movie follows the adventures of two music-loving airheads (Wayne and Garth) whose surreal public access TV show catches the eye of a big-time TV producer. However, the show going pro threatens to change the lives of its hosts on and off the screen, which is particularly bad news for Wayne as he tries to win over the girl of his dreams.\nDirected by Penelope Spheeris, the movie perfectly creeps up to the edge of self-awareness without stepping over it. The result is a film that lampoons everything from public access TV to the record industry, generating laughs from some truly bizarre punchlines. Plus, watching the movie feels like hanging out with two of your silliest friends. And if the onscreen duo of Mike Myers and Dana Carvey can’t get you to sing along to\nBohemian Rhapsody\n, you may need to verify that you have a pulse!\n7\nVenom: The Last Dance\nRelease Year\n2024\nDirector\nKelly Marcel\nRuntime\n1 hour, 49 minutes\nAfter the first Venom movie became a surprise success for Sony, this antihero became a film franchise unto himself. And\nVenom: The Last Dance\nbrings this trilogy to a close with a plot that builds directly off the events of the previous film. Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is the prime suspect of a murder, and he and his alien symbiote are racing to clear their names. Along the way, we learn about Brock’s newest allies and enemies, including a cosmic-level threat who is also the source of all the symbiotes in the universe.\nDirector Kelly Marcel has a very deft hand at adapting some of the crazier characters from the comics into the more grounded world of the Venom film franchise. Plus, Hardy once again does a great job as the title character, imbuing a surprising amount of charm and empathy into a character that mostly wants to devour his enemies. And Sony does something with this movie that even the MCU has been struggling with lately—bringing a long-running story to a satisfying conclusion.\n6\nBird Box\nRelease Year\n2018\nDirector\nSusanne Bier\nRuntime\n2 hours, 4 minutes\nBird Box\nis a film that proves the old adage is true: horror is at its best when it is driven by concepts as simple as they are scary. In this post-apocalyptic film, mysterious beings have spread throughout the planet, and simply looking at them causes madness and suicidal urges. Our main character is a mother trying to guide her children to safety, but that means navigating the world blindfolded, as it’s seemingly the only way to stay alive.\nThanks to director Susanne Bier, this film draws all of the potential out of its awesome premise. We get to see characters acting very intelligently as they try to understand the chaos that has been unleashed on the world, effectively answering our questions about this fictional universe before we can even pose them. And in the finest horror tradition, this movie relentlessly underscores that humans are often the scariest thing you can encounter, even in a world of cosmic terrors.\n5\nThe Old Guard\nRelease Year\n2020\nDirector\nGina Prince-Bythewood\nRuntime\n2 hours, 5 minutes\nThe Old Guard\nadapts the comic series of the same name from superstar scribe Greg Rucka. It follows the adventures of a group of warriors who have Wolverine-like healing abilities. Because of these abilities, they are seemingly immortal. These characters are trying to track down and protect someone who has only recently manifested her own ability. Unfortunately, a shady Big Pharma exec is trying to track our heroes down and use them for his own nefarious research purposes.\nIn the wrong hands, this film could have felt like generic superhero slop. Fortunately, director Gina Prince-Bythewood helps give the film a style and verve that make it very distinct from the usual Marvel and DC fare. Additionally, Charlize Theron gives an effortlessly awesome performance, and she’s a big reason why this quirky superhero film ended up getting a sequel. While that sequel is solid, it can’t beat this first film when it comes to world-building and characterization.\n4\nMamma Mia!\nRelease Year\n2008\nDirector\nPhyllida Lloyd\nRuntime\n1 hour, 48 minutes\nMamma Mia!\nis a crazy movie with an even crazier premise. A young woman is about to be married and wants her father to walk her down the aisle. Unfortunately, her mother had a romantically adventurous past and doesn’t know exactly who the father is. Therefore, the bride-to-be takes matters into her own hands by inviting all three possible daddies to the wedding. Of course, this “solution” kicks off plenty more problems for her and her mother, all of which play out in hilarious fashion, all to songs by ABBA.\nFor many with anxiety about family matters, the plot of\nMamma Mia!\ncould easily be a horror movie. But director Phyllida Lloyd keeps things light, mining all kinds of sidesplitting humor from the bonkers story of this romantic comedy. And thanks to this cast of big names (including Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, and Amanda Seyfried), every scene is positively buzzing with talent.\n3\nWoman of the Hour\nRelease Year\n2023\nDirector\nAnna Kendrick\nRuntime\n1 hour, 34 minutes\nThere are few genres quite as popular now as true crime.\nWoman of the Hour\ntaps into our collective fascination with the macabre by focusing on the strange case of Rodney Alcala, a man who appeared on\nThe Dating Game\nbefore being arrested one year later and revealed as a brutal serial killer. And the movie alternates between scenes of his gruesome crimes and scenes of him trying to woo a young woman on a reality TV show where she must choose the best match among possible suitors.\nThat woman is played by Anna Kendrick, and\nWoman of the Hour\nis also her directorial debut. As it turns out, she is just as talented behind the camera as she is in front of it, adding drama and tension to a story that was already pretty darned scary. The result is a movie that appeals to both those who love true-crime stories and those who just love a well-constructed and tightly-paced horror film, one that is very different (in all the best ways) from\nthe classic horror films of the '80s\n.\n2\nThe Holiday\nRelease Year\n2006\nDirector\nNancy Meyers\nRuntime\n2 hours, 18 minutes\nPut simply,\nThe Holiday\nis a romantic comedy for those who don’t typically enjoy this genre of film. The plot involves two women from opposite sides of the pond (one from LA, the other from Surrey, England) who decide to fight heartbreak in a very unconventional way: by temporarily swapping homes. In traditional genre fashion, they each encounter potential suitors who might transform this into a holiday season to remember. Unfortunately, drama from back home threatens to derail each woman’s chance at creating a new life.\nWriter and director Nancy Meyers helps breathe new life into a genre that had gotten a bit stale. She does this with the help of a killer cast that includes Jack Black, who takes his usual brand of over-the-top comedy down a few notches. His more subdued performance helps the other leads (Kate Winslet, Cameron Diaz, and Jude Law) shine as they create a story about just how messy romance can really be. And nearly two decades later, this film still stands out as one of the best modern romantic comedies ever made.\n1\nFear Street Part One: 1994\nRelease Year\n2021\nDirector\nLeigh Janiak\nRuntime\n1 hour, 47 minutes\nFear Street Part One: 1994\nis the first part of a trilogy that loosely adapts the books written by\nGoosebumps\nscribe R.L. Stine. While the\nGoosebumps\nbooks were light horror for young children, the\nFear Street\nbooks were written for an older audience. Interestingly, this first film is more brutal than any of Stine's books, detailing the story of plucky '90s teens trying to stay one step ahead of an ancient curse. What they discover may completely change their lives, but that’s assuming they survive all the monstrous mayhem threatening to kill them.\nDirector Leigh Janiak gives the movie a fun throwback feel, and horror fans of a certain age will certainly enjoy this loving (if imperfect) recreation of the '90s. She also did a great job creating a movie that can stand on its own while still laying out the complex mythology required to fully understand the next two films. Admittedly,\nFear Street\nis best enjoyed as part of a complete trilogy. But watching this first film is a great way to learn whether you want to take the entire ride or just get off after the first (and arguably best) movie in the series, one that proves why this was\na streaming movie that deserved a sequel\n.\nDo you love movies directed by women?

While technically any computer on our\nbest laptops roundup\nwould work, carrying around some of the heavier laptops around campus all day won't be fun, and other choices don't have the battery life needed to go for so long without a charge.\nStudents need to look for a laptop that's lightweight and has excellent battery life, so they don't need to carry a power cord around and find a place to charge. Your choice should also have the specs you need to get schoolwork done—though how much power you need will depend on your chosen major. A future filmmaker will need something more powerful than a student going for a business degree, for example.\nIt's overwhelming, but we've picked out five fantastic laptops for students to help make your decision easier. One of the choices below will no doubt suit your needs!\n1\nApple MacBook Air M4\nBest for most\nFor a lot of people, you really can't go wrong with a MacBook. These laptops are incredibly light and portable, have fantastic battery life, and tend to last a long time. It wouldn't be surprising if something like the recently released MacBook Air M4 lasts through a four-year school stint.\nOverall, the MacBook Air is just an outstanding laptop. We mention that it's the best laptop for most people in our\nMacBook Air M4 review\n, so it makes sense that it extends to most students as well. The price is right compared to the competition, too, with this model only costing $1,000. Best of all, there's likely to be a good student discount you can take advantage of with your school to get a deep discount. You really can't beat it.\nApple MacBook Air 13 (M4, 2025)\n9\n/\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10\nOperating System\nmacOS\nCPU\nApple M4\nGPU\n8 or 10-core GPU\nRAM\n16, 24, 32GB\nThe M4 MacBook Air retains its sleek design while upgrading to the M4 chip, enhancing performance for media and AI tasks. It also adds a 12MP Center Stage camera, support for two external displays, and Wi-Fi 6E, making it an even better consumer laptop.\nStorage\n256, 512, 1TB, 2TB\nBattery\n53.8Whr\nDisplay (Size, Resolution)\n13.6-inch 2560 x 1664 Liquid Retina Display, 500 nits of peak brightness\nCamera\n12MP CenterStage\nSpeakers\n4-speaker sound system\nColors\nStarlight, Silver, Midnight, Sky Blue\nPorts\n2 x USB-C Thunderbolt 4, 1 x Headphone jack\n$917 at Walmart\n$999 at Amazon\n$999 at Best Buy\nExpand\nCollapse\n2\nSurface Laptop 7\nFor your Windows needs\nThere are a few reasons you want to stay away from macOS and stick with Windows instead. The main reason is app compatibility—if you're using special applications for a class or for your major, you need to make sure the laptop of your choice can run them. While it is possible to\nhave a MacBook launch Windows via Parallels\n, if you're going to spend most of your time in Windows, you'll want a native Windows laptop.\nFor students, the Surface Laptop 7 is the best pick. This model of the Surface line is built to be very light and thin, which is perfect for students running around campus all day. The battery also rivals the MacBook Air, which means you won't need to carry a bulky charger or find an A/C outlet, either. Even the price is the same as the MacBook Air. So if you need Windows for your schoolwork, the Surface Laptop 7 will be the device to pick up.\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop 7\nOperating System\nWindows 11 Home\nCPU\nSnapdragon X Plus\nGPU\nIntegrated Qualcomm Adreno\nRAM\n16GB DDR5\nStorage\n256GB\nDisplay (Size, Resolution)\n13.8 inches, 2304 x 1536\nThe new Surface Laptop is not just faster—it's smarter. Get the most out of your day with accelerated performance that unlocks a new AI era to enable Copilot experiences that transform the way you work, enhancing productivity and creativity. Experience visuals like never before on its stunning and modern Razor-thin touchscreen display.\nColors\nPlatinum\nWeight\n2.96 pounds\nBrand\nMicrosoft\nWebcam\nFront-facing 1080p\nConnectivity\nWi-Fi 7, Bluetooth\n$1000 at Best Buy\nExpand\nCollapse\n3\nApple MacBook Pro M4\nA creative powerhouse\nThe MacBook Air M4 is plenty powerful in its own right, but if you're a creative arts major, upgrading to the MacBook Pro is a good bet. The Pro models offer upgraded specs to make running intensive video and photo editing software easy while retaining the same impressive battery life as the MacBook Air. If the M4 chip isn't powerful enough, you can even opt for an M4 Pro or M4 Max chip and take your MacBook to the next level.\nHowever, it's important to think about what you need power-wise before spending the extra money on the MacBook Pro. The Air models will have enough power to handle most normal schoolwork, so getting the Pro M4 is overkill. But the extra few hundred dollars are worth it to creatives, so you don't need to worry about programs hitching or lagging while trying to get work done.\nApple MacBook Pro (14-Inch, M4)\nOperating System\nMacOS\nCPU\nApple Silicon M4\nRAM\n16GB\nStorage\n512GB\nBattery\nUp to 18 hours\nColors\nSilver, Space Black\nPowered by an impressive M4 chip, the 14-inch MacBook Pro starts with 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, a 10-core CPU, and a 10-core GPU, available in Space Black or Silver.\nBrand\nApple\nConnectivity\nWi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3\n$1299 at Amazon\n$1299 at Best Buy\n$1413 at Walmart\nExpand\nCollapse\n4\nASUS ROG Zephyrus G14\nFor work and play\nFinding a gaming laptop that's also good for taking around campus is not easy. Many gaming laptops can be loud, which isn't ideal for taking notes in a classroom. They also tend to be heavy, which makes carrying them around all day a (literal) pain. There isn't a lot of overlap between the two use cases, but if you're willing to make a few sacrifices, the ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 will be the laptop for you.\nThe Zephyrus G14 weighs just over three pounds, around the same as a few of the other picks on our list. You'll get a 1TB SSD, a dedicated GPU, and up to 10 hours of battery life—all really good for a gaming laptop built to be ultra-portable. The G14 only has 16GB of RAM, so you can't play every game at max settings, and no doubt playing modern games with high spec requirements will drain the battery a lot faster than 10 hours.\nBut really, not many laptops can straddle the student-friendly line that the Zephyrus G14 does, so for those who want both portability and gaming prowess, this is the laptop to buy.\nASUS ROG Zephyrus G14\nOperating System\nWindows 11 Home\nCPU\nAMD Ryzen 9 8000 Series\nGPU\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060\nRAM\n16GB DDR5\nStorage\n1TB\nBattery\nUp to 10 hours\nThe ROG Zephyrus G14 has been redesigned with an all-new premium aluminum chassis for increased durability and elegance. At 0.63 inches thin and weighing in at just 3.31lbs, this gaming powerhouse combines portability with cutting-edge technology.\nDisplay (Size, Resolution)\n14 inches, 2880 x 1800\nWeight\n3.31 pounds\nBrand\nASUS\nWebcam\nFront-facing 1080p\nConnectivity\nBluetooth, Wi-Fi 6E\n$1600 at Best Buy\nExpand\nCollapse\n5\nLenovo IdeaPad Flex 3i\nJust the basics\nNot everyone needs a powerhouse laptop. For many, all you may need is something that'll open a web browser and a word processor. After all, if you have a desktop at home or in the dorm room, you may not need a laptop that can do it all as well.\nFor these students, cheap and effective is the way to go, and the Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 3i is precisely that. This Chromebook only costs $300, and you get all the basics you need covered when you're on campus. Chrome OS can handle all the Google productivity apps, and since those all sync online to your Google account, you don't need to worry about getting something from one device to another. But with only 4GB of RAM, don't expect to be able to multitask or run any resource-heavy programs.\nThis is strictly a laptop meant for the basics—if you need something more, you'll need to look into some of the options above.\nLenovo IdeaPad Flex 3i Chromebook\nOperating System\nChrome OS\nCPU\nIntel Processor N100 Quad-Core\nGPU\nIntegrated Intel UHD Graphics\nRAM\n4GB DDR5\nStorage\n64GB\nBattery\nUp to 12 hours\nUntether the limits of your study space with an agile IdeaPad Flex 3i Chromebook.

They get far more mileage from their energy than gas-powered vehicles ever could.\nBut EVs have their quirks—mainly range limits and charging times. If you have a\ncharger at home\nand don’t drive long distances often, they’re easy to live with; otherwise, it can get tricky.\nThat’s where\nplug-in hybrids\ncome in, offering solid electric range for daily trips with gas backup for long hauls. If you want an affordable, family-friendly SUV that nails this balance, one standout PHEV deserves a closer look.\nTo give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various manufacturers and other authoritative sources, including the EPA and J.D. Power.\n2025 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV: The Most Affordable Three-Row Plug-in Hybrid\nThe\n2025 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV\nis one of the smartest buys in the plug-in hybrid market. Believe it or not, Mitsubishi is still in the game—and their electrified powertrain packs a punch with solid all-electric range and respectable fuel economy once the battery runs low.\nBut there’s more to this\nSUV\nthan just efficiency. It offers strong performance, comes standard with all-wheel drive, and surprises with an interior that feels a lot more upscale than you might expect.\nStarting Under $43,000—a More Budget-Friendly Choice Than the Pacifica or Sorento PHEVs\nMitsubishi\nThe Outlander PHEV offers solid value for its price. The base ES model kicks off around $42,480, including destination fees, while the fully loaded Platinum Edition still comes in at a reasonable $52,480.\nCompared to other family-friendly PHEVs, that’s a competitive deal. For example, the\n2025 Chrysler Pacifica Plug-In Hybrid\nstarts around $53,000, and the\n2025 Kia Sorento\nPHEV EX AWD tops $49,000 with fees included.\nRoom for Seven With Versatility Built for Family Life\nMitsubishi\nThe Outlander PHEV pulls double duty for families with a flexible, fairly roomy cabin. It seats up to seven, though the third-row bench fits two small kids comfortably—not so much adults back there.\nThat third row shows up in the regular Outlander too, but with a different design. The standard model has a split-folding seatback, while the PHEV’s is a single piece that folds into a floor well—likely a clever workaround to make room for the battery pack.\nDesigned for Electric Driving, Built for Real-World Use\nMitsubishi\nThis plug-in hybrid SUV is surprisingly practical for everyday use. Its all-electric range is solid, but what really stands out is the total driving range—you\ncan go about 420 miles\non a full battery and gas tank.\nRealistically, you’ll probably need a break long before the Outlander does. It’s perfect for those who want electric efficiency without worrying about running out of juice on longer trips.\nAbout 38 Miles of Electric Range—Perfect for School Runs\nMitsubishi\nThis SUV packs a hefty 20-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery, giving it an estimated 38 miles of all-electric range—pretty impressive for daily driving. That’s just a mile shy of the\nFord Escape PHEV\n, though the Escape is front-wheel drive only.\nThe\nToyota RAV4 Plug-In Hybrid\nstretches the electric range a bit further to 42 miles, but the difference isn’t huge. When it comes to fuel efficiency, the Outlander lags behind, with 64 MPGe on electric power and 26 MPG on gas, while the Escape and RAV4 post much higher numbers.\nMitsubishi\nThe Outlander charges up to 80 percent in about 38 minutes, which is pretty quick for a plug-in hybrid.\nThe catch? It uses a CHAdeMO fast-charging port—a connector that’s becoming harder to find in the U.S. as the newer\nNorth American Charging Standard (NACS)\ntakes over.\nOn the bright side, it still has the standard J1772 port for everyday Level 2 charging, so topping up at home or public chargers is hassle-free.\nSeamless Switch to Gas Power on Longer Trips\nMitsubishi\nUnder the hood, this SUV packs a 2.4-liter MIVEC four-cylinder engine that keeps things running smoothly. But the real magic comes from its two electric motors—one sits at the rear axle, delivering that standard all-wheel drive for better traction and control.\n2025 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV Performance Specifications\nEngine\n2.4-Liter 4-Cylinder + 2 Electric Motors\nHorsepower\n248 HP\nTorque\n332 LB-FT\nTransmission\nCVT\nDriveline\nAll-Wheel Drive\n0–60 MPH\n6.6 Seconds (Car and Driver)\nFuel Economy (Combined)\n64 MPGe\nThe Outlander PHEV packs a combined 248 horsepower and 332 pound-feet of torque, giving it plenty of pep. That power gets this family SUV from zero to 60 mph in a brisk 6.6 seconds—significantly quicker than the non-hybrid version, which takes about 8.2 seconds.\nFlexible Design Built With Families in Mind\nMitsubishi\nThis SUV steps up its family-friendly game with a crisp 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and an eight-inch touchscreen. If you go for the SE trim or higher, you get an even bigger nine-inch infotainment display.\nSafety is a big focus here, too, with a solid lineup of driver assistance features like:\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go\nLane-keeping assist\nRoad sign recognition\nAutomatic emergency braking\nPredictive Forward Collision Warning\nBlind spot monitoring\nLane-change assist\nSmall Enough for Tight Spots, Big Enough for Adventures\nEven with three rows, this Mitsubishi stays surprisingly easy to drive and park. With a wheelbase of 106.5 inches and a total length of 185.4 inches, the Outlander PHEV is just a bit longer than the RAV4 Plug-In Hybrid and the Escape PHEV—making it roomy but still manageable.\nThird Row Seating and Cargo Space That Work Together\nMitsubishi\nThe Outlander PHEV can seat seven, but what about hauling your gear? Mitsubishi says there’s 30.8 cubic feet of cargo space behind the second row and 64.7 cubic feet with the front row folded—solid numbers for a midsize SUV.\nInterestingly, they don’t provide a cargo figure for the space behind the third row, which leaves a bit of a mystery when all seven seats are in use.\nA Hybrid That’s Easy on Your Wallet for Maintenance\nMitsubishi\nThe\nOutlander PHEV\ncomes with a solid warranty that shields you from surprise repair costs. You get a five-year/60,000-mile basic warranty and a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain guarantee to keep you covered.\nOn top of that, there’s a two-year/30,000-mile maintenance plan and five years of unlimited-mile roadside assistance. Mitsubishi’s generous coverage helps keep expenses down and gives you serious peace of mind.\nEveryday Driving Made Cheaper Thanks to EV Power\nWhile it might not top the charts for efficiency, this plug-in hybrid SUV still holds its own when it comes to saving you money. The EPA estimates it could help owners pocket about $1,500 in fuel costs over five years compared to the average new car on the road today.\nAn Affordable Option That Stands Out in the PHEV SUV Crowd\nThe Outlander PHEV might not match the fuel economy of the Escape or RAV4, but it offers third-row seating that those two don’t—and the Ford lacks all-wheel drive, too.\nPricing-wise, the Ford starts just under $39,000 with delivery, a bit cheaper than the Mitsubishi, while the Toyota RAV4 sits a few thousand dollars higher, starting above $46,000 with fees included.\nAutomotive\nHybrid Cars\nSUVs\nFollow\nFollowed\nLike\nShare\nFacebook\nX\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nFlipboard\nCopy link\nEmail\nReaders like you help support How-To Geek.

As an added perk, the sound system is pretty great, too.\nHisense 75U75QG\n$1398\n$1999\nSave $601\n8\n/\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10\nBrand\nHisense\nDisplay Size\n75-inches\nDimensions\n65.7x37.9x3 inches\nThe Hisense U75QG 4K Google TV is a miniLED display with a vibrant image with incredible contrast thanks to a high peak brightness combined with thousands of local dimming zones.It also features a very capable 2.1.2 sound system built in.\nOperating System\nGoogle TV\nPower Consumption\n310W active, 0.5W idle\nDisplay Type\nMini-LED\nDisplay Resolution\n4K\nConnectivity\nWi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth (5.3), Ethernet, HDMI, USB\nRefresh rate\n165Hz (288Hz at 1080p)\nWeight\n63.9lbs (68.3 lbs with stand)\nSpeakers\n2.1.2\nPeak Brightness\n3000 nits\nVESA\n600x400 (M6)\nDimming Zones\n2300\nPros & Cons\nIncredible Maximum Brightness\nGood Integrated Sound\nVibrant, Engaging Colors\nColor Settings Required Some Tweaking\nAI Features Are Not Very Helpful\n$1399 at bestbuy\n$1398 at Walmart\n$1398 at Amazon\nExpand\nCollapse\nPrice and Availability\nThe Hisense U7QG is available in 55-, 65-, 75-, 85-, and 100-inch variants. I reviewed the 75U7QG, which is the 75-inch variant.\nThe normal sale price of the 75-inch unit is $1,999, though you sometimes find it discounted as low as $1098. The\naverage\nprice tends to float around $1,400 dollars.\nYou can buy the TVs in the U7GQ lineup from Best Buy, Walmart, and Amazon.\nSpecifications\nBrand\nHisense\nDisplay Size\n75-inches\nDimensions\n65.7x37.9x3 inches\nOperating System\nGoogle TV\nPower Consumption\n310W active, 0.5W idle\nDisplay Type\nMini-LED\nDisplay Resolution\n4K\nConnectivity\nWi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth (5.3), Ethernet, HDMI, USB\nRefresh rate\n165Hz (288Hz at 1080p)\nWeight\n63.9lbs (68.3 lbs with stand)\nSpeakers\n2.1.2\nPeak Brightness\n3000 nits\nVESA\n600x400 (M6)\nDimming Zones\n2300\nExpand\nCollapse\nFantastic Color, Brightness, and Contrast\nAfter the initial setup process, which was pretty painless, I fired up a nature documentary to put the TV through its paces. I was immediately impressed by the colors, which were vibrant but not oversaturated.\nI did find myself fiddling with the default color settings a bit to tweak them a bit to my liking. However, that really isn't a mark against the TV, since it is largely a matter of taste, and the TV makes it quite easy to change things to your liking.\nIt is an understatement to say the TV is bright. When I turned it up, flashes of light in action scenes from explosions or fire actually became slightly uncomfortable to look at. Bright scenes easily cast shadows on the wall behind me, even when the lights in the room were on.\nNick Lewis / How-To Geek\nOf course, all that brightness isn't wasted. Because the 75QG lineup is a\nMiniLED system\nwith\ndiscrete dimming zones\n, you're not just constantly assaulted by a hopelessly bright screen. Explosions in the dark are bright, but the area around the explosion remains dark. Panning past a torch or the Sun really highlights just how well the dimming zones work in coordination with a high peak brightness.\nTo really see how it handled dark scenes, I rewatched the most infamously-dark episode of television in recent memory: Season 8, Episode 3 of\nGame of Thrones\n, \"The Long Night.\" Much to my pleasant surprise, the episode looked good, even great, and so different from what I remembered that I half-wondered if the episode had been remastered after the negative feedback. As it turns out, it hasn't been—the TV just thrives when it can show off its high contrast ratio.\nThe combination of a 4K display with great color and contrast makes for a memorable viewing experience that left me with only one thought: \"No wonder traditional movie theaters are struggling.\"\nA Cinematic Gaming Experience\nThis TV, and the rest of the models in the lineup, boast an impressive\n165Hz\nmaximum refresh rate\n—high enough that even competitive gamers won't balk.\nTo give it a test, I hauled my PC into the spare room where I'd set up the TV and tried out Fortnite, Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077, and Elite Dangerous.\nOn the default settings, Fortnite was\nplayable\n, though the input latency was noticeable. I'm not an avid competitive gamer and not especially sensitive to latency, but switching to Game Mode fixed the issue well enough that I didn't notice it anymore. Game mode doesn't show up until you manually switch to a different HDMI input.\nHowever, games like Fortnite are not where this television is at its best. Cyberpunk 2077 and Elite Dangerous were both\nexceptional\n, since their art choices and settings both lend themselves to the strengths of the TV: color, brightness, and contrast. Baldur's Gate 3 was also very pleasant.\nNick Lewis / How-To Geek\nComing out of FTL in Elite Dangerous to refuel near a star was an impressive experience. The star itself was blindingly bright, but the dim stars in the backdrop of space were still easily visible.\nCyberpunk 2077, as you might expect, was the game that impressed me the most. Night City is a city of visual extremes: neon signs in dark alleyways, bright shining towers visible from dirty street corners, and colorful holographic fish suspended in Arasaka Plaza.\nNick Lewis / How-To Geek\nI've always found gaming on modern televisions (that is, LCDs and OLEDs instead of\nCRTs\n) very lacking compared to dedicated gaming monitors. The 75U75QG is the first display that actually managed to change my mind.\nIf you're looking for a cinematic gaming television to pair with a console or a gaming PC at this price point, it would be at the top of my list,\nespecially\nif you can get it on sale.\nBetter Sound Than I Expected\nThe Hisense 75U75QG technically has a 2.1.2 sound system built in, which means it has front left and right speakers, a subwoofer, and two upfiring Atmos speakers, which are designed to bounce sound off your ceiling to create the illusion of something above you.\nThe front speakers are, in a word, fine. Dialogue is clear and there is good left-right separation, no doubt largely because of the physical size of the television. Because of the design of the speakers, the listening sweet spot is massive, which is nice if you have it placed in a room with seating scattered around.\nThe subwoofer is as good as you can ask for on a device that is only a few inches thick. It gets admirably low but is decidedly muddy. That didn't bother me all that much when watching television or movies, but it is very noticeable when you're listening to bass-heavy music.\nThe real surprises were the Atmos speakers. When I first fired up the television, I didn't realize there\nwere A\ntmos speakers, and I was surprised to hear a jet fly over my head while watching\nTop Gun.\nThe integrated Atmos speakers don't beat\nAtmos speakers\nphysically mounted on your ceiling, but they're easily on par with many of the upfiring Atmos speakers I've heard that come with soundbars.\nOn the whole, the sound experience was good, and a huge improvement over the tinny, hollow sound that was typical of flat-screen TVs for many years.\nHowever, a TV with visuals this nice really deserves\na solid home-theater sound system\nto go with it.\nLackluster AI But Nice Software\nThe TV's operating system is Google TV, and that end of things is actually very nice. The user interface is intuitive and easy to use. I had no problems navigating the customization options to tweak the picture and audio to my liking.\nNick Lewis / How-To Geek\nNo product in 2025 would be complete without all sorts of smart AI features, and this TV is not exempt.\nThe \"enhancement\" options (AI or otherwise) are numerous, and include things like:\nAI Contrast\nSmooth Gradient\nAI Super Resolution\nNoise Reduction\nMPEG Noise Reduction\nMotion Enhancement\nMotion Clearness\nThe only problem? With two exceptions, they're all pretty bad.\nThe worst offender is Motion Enhancement, which produced a strange visual effect that I found literally nauseating to watch for extended periods. After watching a movie and a few episodes of television, I disabled it completely and will not be using it.\nThe\nAI upscaling\nwas middling. In some situations, it did make things appear a bit smoother and sharper, but I would never say that 720p content got anywhere close to looking like native 4K or even 1080p content. That isn't really a fault of the software, though. The reality is that convincingly upscaling standard definition or high definition content to full HD or 4K requires way more processing power than a TV's integrated computer can currently provide—you need a gaming GPU at least.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, the Smooth Gradient Option—which smooths out lines in the sky—actually worked very well, especially on older content. I left it enabled.\nLots of Ports and a Nice Remote\nAs I was attaching various things to test them out, I was pleasantly surprised by the number and type of ports I found.\nThere are four HDMI ports, two USB ports, an Ethernet port, an optical port, and a few aux ports. The third HDMI port is the one you need to use if you're going to connect an audio video receiver to the TV and use eARC.\nThe remote is also very nice. It has a few buttons for popular apps like Netflix, YouTube, Prime, Disney, Tubi, and one customizable.\nNick Lewis / How-To Geek\nMy only complaint about the remote is the design of the circular piece in the middle. The small grooves aggressively collect anything that might be on your fingers, and it isn't particularly easy to clean, so you'll definitely want to skip the cheetos if you're handling it.\nNick Lewis / How-To Geek\nShould You Buy the Hisense 75U7QG?\nThe TV is great all around, and it is easy to recommend to anyone when it is on sale around $1,100, or even $1,500. The native 165Hz refresh rate even makes this compelling for people who want to use it for gaming. You'd be hard-pressed to do better.\nOther televisions in the lineup are also going to be competitive, especially at a discount.\nAt $2,000 the\nHisense 75U75QG\nfaces stiffer competition from all the other big manufacturers, and it would be worth your time (and money) to carefully compare TVs in that price range.\nHisense 75U75QG\n$1398\n$1999\nSave $601\n8\n/\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10\nBrand\nHisense\nDisplay Size\n75-inches\nDimensions\n65.7x37.9x3 inches\nThe Hisense U75QG 4K Google TV is a miniLED display with a vibrant image with incredible contrast thanks to a high peak brightness combined with thousands of local dimming zones.It also features a very capable 2.1.2 sound system built in.\nOperating System\nGoogle TV\nPower Consumption\n310W active, 0.5W idle\nDisplay Type\nMini-LED\nDisplay Resolution\n4K\nConnectivity\nWi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth (5.3), Ethernet, HDMI, USB\nRefresh rate\n165Hz (288Hz at 1080p)\nWeight\n63.9lbs (68.3 lbs with stand)\nSpeakers\n2.1.2\nPeak Brightness\n3000 nits\nVESA\n600x400 (M6)\nDimming Zones\n2300\n$1399 at bestbuy\n$1398 at Walmart\n$1398 at Amazon\nExpand\nCollapse\nAudio/Video\nGoogle TV\nFollow\nFollowed\nLike\nShare\nFacebook\nX\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nFlipboard\nCopy link\nEmail\nReaders like you help support How-To Geek.

I've handpicked these three TV series on\nApple TV+\nthat are short enough for you to binge over a single weekend, but are loaded with action, drama, laughs, and even some weird robot sci-fi stuff to make it feel like a real escape for a while.\nSo sink into your comfy place and let these quick weekend binge shows give you the work-week reward you deserve.\n3\nSmoke\nRelease Year\n2025\nSeasons\n1\nEpisodes\n9\nOverall Running Time\n7 hours 47 minutes\nStatus\nUnconfirmed\nThe same pairing that delivered us the Emmy-winning Apple TV+ psychodrama\n​​​​​​\nBlack Bird\nhas traded the cold, sterile prison walls for the blazing flames of small-town arson investigators.\nTaron Egerton and Dennis Lehane team up again for\nSmoke\n, a nine-episode true-crime thriller with a hot cast and even hotter premise.\nDrawing material from the popular\nFirebug\npodcast, Egerton stars as hotshot arson investigator Dave Gudsen, whose department is under pressure to find two dangerous arsonists wreaking havoc on the fictional town of Umberland. One firebug is the disturbed Freddy (Mtare Guma Mbaho Mwine in a breakout role), who likes to use milk jugs filled with fryer oil from his chicken shack job. The other is a little more complicated, and you'll have to wait for the second episode to find out. But it sparks an intense cat-and-mouse chase with Dave's hardened partner (Jurnee Smollett)—who has her own disturbing relationship with fire—leading the charge.\nSmoke\ndoesn't take long to get burning, and features some sharp and deeply complex character work from Egerton and costars, which also includes Greg Kinnear as Gnudsen's surly chief, Harvey.\n2\nMurderbot\nRelease Year\n2025\nSeasons\n10\nEpisodes\n4\nOverall Running Time\n4 hours 11 minutes\nStatus\nRenewed\nMurderbot\nis one of my favorite Apple TV+ series that the streaming service has delivered in a long time. It's a weird and quirky dystopian sci-fi series with snackable episodes that each left me wanting another. Luckily, you won't have that problem and can keep bingeing until you've had your fill.\nIn a stroke of casting genius, Alexander Skarsgård is SecUnit, a \"Security Unit\" cyborg who is assigned to protect the members of the naive and flaky PreservationAux research team sent to an alien planet. But this SecUnit is different—it's managed to secretly hack the governing programming that keeps it in check (read: from killing humans). Fortunately, all that's really done is make it sarcastic, a bit of a jerk, and obsessed with a crappy\nStar Trek\n-like\nsoap opera it's downloaded called\nThe Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon\n. However, for all of its disdain for humanity (it calls itself Murderbot), SecUnit keeps the crew safe and may be the most human of them all.\nAdapted from Martha Wells' popular novellas\nThe Murderbot Diaries\n, the satirical 10-episode series has been renewed for a second season on Apple TV+.\n1\nLessons in Chemistry\nRelease Year\n2023\nSeasons\n1\nEpisodes\n8\nOverall Running Time\n6 hours 6 minutes\nStatus\nEnded\nI've been a Brie Larson fan since she played shallow popstar Envy Adams in\nScott Pilgrim vs the World\nin 2010. Of course, she's moved on since then (\nRoom\n,\nEnd Game\n, Captain Marvel), but I've admired her for choosing projects on both the big and small screens, one of the latest of which is\nLessons in Chemistry\n.\nThe Apple TV+ limited series just killed with 10 Emmy nominations, including a lead actress nom for Larson, who was finally given a role worthy of her talents after quite some time. That role is Elizabeth Zott, a headstrong, brilliant lab chemist in 1950s Los Angeles, whose career is derailed by the sexism of the era. Fired for stepping out of her place, and raising a daughter on her own, Zott's talent as a cook (it's all chemistry, after all) serendipitously lands her a job as the host of the TV cooking show\nSupper at Six\n, which becomes a huge hit. Zott's charm and intelligence is fun to watch, as she undermines the authority of her male bosses, including the brilliantly irritated Rainn Wilson.\nLessons in Chemistry\nlooks gorgeous, with era-accurate retro set pieces and period costumes (it's lone Emmy win), and offers wit, real drama, and a feminist bite.\nApple TV+ may not pump out the volume of series and movies as streamers such as Netflix or Prime Video, but the quality of its\naward-winning programming\n, like\nSeverance, The Morning Show,\nand live sports, cannot be denied.\nApple TV+\nVisit Apple TV+\nExpand\nCollapse\nStreaming\nFollow\nFollowed\nLike\nShare\nFacebook\nX\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nFlipboard\nCopy link\nEmail\nReaders like you help support How-To Geek.

These are three great\nAmazon Prime Video\nseries that are bound to keep you glued to the screen.\n3\nGood Boy\nRelease Year\n2025\nSeasons\n1\nEpisodes\n16\nOverall Running Time\n18 hours 21 minutes\nStatus\nUnconfirmed\nGood Boy\nis a South Korean series with a slightly absurd but fun premise: a group of Olympic athletes are recruited into the police to tackle major crimes. The idea is that these people all have talents unique to their sports (like fencing, shooting, and boxing) that, when put together, make them a force to be reckoned with. Their reasons for joining the police are also varied—for example, Ji Han-na (Kim So-hyun) wants to follow in her father's footsteps, while Kim Jong-hyeon (Lee Sang-yi) used to date Han-na and wants to reconnect.\nThe ensemble cast does a top job at bringing their characters to life and balancing the show's dramatic and comedic tones. Park Bo-gum is charming as boxer Yoon Dong-ju, Heo Sung-tae (who you may recognize from\nSquid Game\n) has a strong presence as team leader Ko Man-sik, and Oh Jung-se is brilliant as questionable customs officer Min Ju-yeong. While the series does feel a little too long at 16 episodes, the actors and action keep you invested.\nSpeaking of action, that's one of\nGood Boy\n's standout features. It's fast-paced and cinematic. Sure, it might sometimes be unrealistic and silly, like when discus thrower Shin Jae-hong (Tae Won-seok) destroys a speeding car with a manhole cover, but that's part of the enjoyment. Suspend your disbelief, enable the English subtitles (always preferable over a dub for live action, in my opinion), and have a good time.\n2\nBoundless\nRelease Year\n2022\nSeasons\n1\nEpisodes\n6\nOverall Running Time\n4 hours 17 minutes\nStatus\nEnded\nContinuing with the theme of Prime Video's decent foreign-language productions comes\nBoundless\n, a Spanish limited series that tells the tale of the three-year voyage that began in 1519 and marked the first circumnavigation of Earth. The show's two protagonists are the Portuguese Ferdinand Magellan (Rodrigo Santoro) and the Spanish Juan Sebastián Elcano (Álvaro Morte), the real-life explorers.\nMy knowledge of this slice of history is rusty, so I can't comment on how accurate the portrayal of the events is, but I do know the show itself is thrilling, with great character dynamics and beautiful backdrops. As you might imagine, the journey is fraught with danger—it's no spoiler to say that many of the men who set out from Spain don't make it back alive—but also excitement.\nAmusingly, the show's director, Simon West, is also responsible for Rick Astley's video for\nNever Gonna Give You Up\n. Though it's more likely that his experience directing action movies like\nCon Air\nand\nLara Croft: Tomb Raider\nstood him in good stead for\nBoundless\n.\n1\nThe Fall\nRelease Year\n2013 - 2016\nSeasons\n3\nEpisodes\n17\nOverall Running Time\n17 hours 21 minutes\nStatus\nEnded\nIn\nThe Fall\n, Gillian Anderson plays Stella Gibson, a senior officer for the London police who is seconded to Belfast to review a murder investigation that the local force is struggling to solve. It soon becomes clear that this is the work of a serial killer. But this isn't a whodunit for the viewer because we immediately learn that Paul Spector is behind the killings—a supposedly normal family man, creepily played by Jamie Dornan.\nWhat follows is a game of cat and mouse, with the tension slowly and masterfully building through each episode. It's all stylishly shot, too (even though it perhaps isn't a glowing advertisement for Northern Ireland, what with all the crime). Anderson is excellent as the smart and icy lead, but so are the supporting cast; it's always nice to see Colin Morgan on screen, who got his start in BBC's\nMerlin\n.\nThe Fall\nlasted three seasons and I think the first is the best, as is often the case with these dark crime dramas. That's not to say the rest isn't worth watching, because it definitely is, just that it doesn't quite maintain that initial intrigue. Regardless, the first season ends on a cliffhanger anyway, so you almost have no choice but to see it through.\nThese shows will take up a decent chunk of time, but if you're finished with the binge and want some more entertainment, don't forget that\nPrime Video has plenty of great movies\ntoo.\nAmazon Prime Video\nAll of these series, along with plenty of other original and licensed movies and shows, are available to stream on Amazon Prime Video.\nVisit Amazon Prime Video\nExpand\nCollapse\nStreaming\nAmazon Prime Video\nFollow\nFollowed\nLike\nShare\nFacebook\nX\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nFlipboard\nCopy link\nEmail\nReaders like you help support How-To Geek.

Discovering a new show isn't always easy, especially if you're unlucky enough to be using Netflix's latest redesigned interface.\nThankfully, you have someone who watches too much TV at your disposal—me! Here are three shows that are great to binge because you can start and finish them over a few days.\n3\nA.P. Bio\nRelease Year\n2018 - 2021\nSeasons\n4\nEpisodes\n42\nOverall Running Time\n15 hours 22 minutes\nStatus\nEnded\nGlenn Howerton puts in a delightfully unhinged performance in\nIt's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\n, so it's always nice to see him elsewhere. In the sitcom\nA.P. Bio\nhe plays Jack, a Harvard philosophy professor who winds up in his Ohio hometown teaching biology at high school. The situation is far from his ideal, not helped by the fact that he's living in his deceased mother's home. Rather than teach the subject he's there for, Jack decides to use his students to help him enact revenge on those he believes have wronged him.\nI wasn't totally sold on\nA.P. Bio\nwhen I started, but everything clicked after a couple of episodes, especially as you get to see more of Jack's students and colleagues (including Patton Oswalt as the well-meaning principal and Paula Pell as his hilarious secretary). Howerton can play this type of role with his eyes closed, but it's hard to complain when he's so good at it. The jokes are rapid and the short episodes make for a perfect binge.\nThe show has finished now and had the honor of being canceled twice—once after the second season, when it was then resurrected on Peacock, and again after the fourth. It's a shame, especially because more people can discover it now that it's on Netflix, but I'm grateful it lasted for four funny seasons.\n2\nThe Great British Baking Show\nRelease Year\n2010 - present\nSeasons\n15 (8 on Netflix)\nEpisodes\n144 (80 on Netflix)\nOverall Running Time\n10 hours 1 minute (collection 12)\nStatus\nOngoing\nThe Great British Baking Show\n(known in its native country as\nThe Great British Bake Off\n) is an annual competition that brings together a group of amateur bakers to test their skills making cakes, bread, biscuits, and many other tasty delights. Their creations are judged by two professional bakers—currently Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith—who consider elements like taste, appearance, and how well the contestant stuck to the brief. Someone is eliminated each week until the final three remain.\nUnlike many other reality competitions, the atmosphere on the show is positively charming. It's held outdoors in a large tent, complete with gingham tablecloths and bunting, and the hosts wander around with encouragement and silly jokes. But the most important factor is that the contestants seem to genuinely get along. There is no backstabbing or scripted drama; it's just a diverse group of people with a passion for baking, pulling off remarkable kitchen magic under time pressure. You wouldn't think watching people knead dough or temper chocolate would be this fun, but it is.\nThe season numbering for\nThe Great British Baking Show\nis a little confusing. Netflix only has seasons 5 to 12 (which it calls collections), though technically season 5 was season 8 in the UK. The earlier seasons, following the UK's numbering, are available on\nThe Roku Channel\n. It's not much of an issue, though. Each season is standalone, with a fresh batch of bakers, so you can dive in wherever you like—a single season is ideal for a weekend binge, as you can see an entire competition from beginning to end.\n1\nMaid\nRelease Year\n2021\nSeasons\n1\nEpisodes\n10\nOverall Running Time\n8 hours 59 minutes\nStatus\nEnded\nMaid\nis essential viewing. It's inspired by Stephanie Land's memoir, with an extraordinary Margaret Qualley in the lead role. The show is about a young mother called Alex who is trying to do the best for her daughter—she leaves her abusive partner and takes a cleaning job in order to make ends meet. It's raw and affecting without being melodramatic.\nIf you've seen Qualley in recent movies like\nThe Substance\nand\nDrive-Away Dolls\n, you know how talented she is. She's on sublime form here, with an unshowy performance that makes it easy to connect to Alex's journey and root for her success. The rest of the cast are great too, served well by the nuanced writing, and it's neat to see Qualley's real mother, Andie MacDowell, play her fictional one.\nNetflix has put out a lot of original series over the years and not all of them land. In my opinion, this ranks up there as one of its best. It was nominated for Emmys and Golden Globes and became one of the streamer's most-watched shows when it debuted in 2021. Even if you tend to shy away from grounded dramas, I strongly recommend you check out\nMaid\n. It'll stay with you long after you've finished watching.\nWith shows like these, I think\nNetflix is worth the subscription cost\n. Even if you only sign up for a month and binge all three, that's good value. There is plenty more to recommend though, so join me again next week for my picks.\nNetflix\nStream all of these brilliant shows, along with plenty more licensed and original programming, with a monthly Netflix subscription.\nVisit Netflix\nExpand\nCollapse\nStreaming\nNetflix\nFollow\nFollowed\nLike\nShare\nFacebook\nX\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nFlipboard\nCopy link\nEmail\nReaders like you help support How-To Geek.

There are tons of low-profile options that are just as clacky, even as they might have a tad less travel. Now, Razer's latest keyboards are here, and they're as thin as they get.\nRazer has announced the launch of two new low-profile gaming keyboards, the BlackWidow V4 Low-profile HyperSpeed and the BlackWidow V4 Low-profile Tenkeyless HyperSpeed. The big thing about them, as we hinted to before, is how thin they are. The company's green (clicky), yellow (linear), and orange (tactile) switches have been redesigned in a new low-profile flavor, with a reduced key height and a shorter travel distance, which Razer states promotes a more natural wrist alignment for users and potentially increases comfort during extended use without the need for a separate wrist rest. The keyboards feature a front height of 18.5mm and an angled chassis to further support a neutral wrist position.\nThe new switches have a circular stem wall intended to let Razer's Chroma RGB lighting shine through the translucent top housing of the switch. Each switch is factory-lubricated to ensure smooth key travel and is rated for up to 80 million keystrokes.\nAs far as the actual construction, both the full-size and tenkeyless models feature a 5052 aluminum alloy top case for durability. Internally, the keyboards are equipped with dual sound-dampening foam layers and a stainless steel plate, which, combined with pre-lubricated stabilizers, allow for a clean and satisfying typing sound despite what the low-profile switches would otherwise allow for. Yes, these are thin, but they are still mechanical, and Razer wants you to be very aware of that fact while you're using it.\nBoth keyboards support Razer's HyperSpeed Wireless technology, which is basically souped-up 2.4 GHz connectivity with a polling rate of up to 1000Hz for low-latency input. A single dongle can be used to connect both the keyboard and a compatible Razer gaming mouse. The keyboards also support Bluetooth connectivity, allowing you to pair them with up to three different devices for multitasking across various platforms.\nThese are also probably as feature-rich as a low-profile keyboard can get. The keyboards include a clickable multi-function roller and a set of dedicated macro buttons. These controls provide quick access to functions such as media playback, volume adjustment, and custom macros without interrupting gameplay. The keyboards also feature a Power Saving Mode, which can extend the battery life up to 980 hours on a single charge.

However, the 90s were a pivotal time for film where many things were transitioning from long-established traditions and the modern methods of the 2000s and later. This is why I think the movies of the 90s are so special.\n10\nThe Peak of Practical Effects\nLucas Gouveia/How-To Geek\nThis is the decade where\nCG\nfinally became viable for mainstream use in film. Starting with movies like\nThe Abyss\nand\nTerminator 2: Judgment Day\nand rounding the decade off with CG-heavy blockbusters like\nThe Matrix\n.\nHowever, while these were the early days of CG, it was also the end of decades of practical effects experience. So we got movies like\nTotal Recall\n,\nJurassic Park\n,\nand\nDeath Becomes Her\nwith astounding practical effects, with perhaps wonky CGI thrown into the mix in some cases.\nHappily, we are now going back to practical effects becoming more common in movies, with the added bonus of mature CG to enhance those in-camera VFX to give us the best of both worlds.\n9\nThe Rise (and Peak) of the VHS Rental Culture\nVCR with cassette tape\nWhile people were obviously renting movies on VHS in the 80s, VCR ownership peaked by the year 2000 and by 2001\nDVD sales surpassed VHS for the first time\n. In short, the 90s were when VHS rental and VCR ownership were red-hot.\nNow, VHS is objectively a terrible format, and since I had been unlucky enough to experience\nLaserDisc\nin the 90s, I was painfully aware of this. However, nothing beats heading out to a rental store on a Friday night and browsing the shelves of tapes, looking for something to watch over the weekend.\nIn particular, the delectable selection of terrible direct-to-video slop of the 90s practically defined this era for me. There was always some sort of combo deal where you could take some cheap and nasty movie along with a new release, and so you'd just look at the covers, read the blurb, and still have no idea what you're getting into. No internet, and no way to check reviews—it was amazing.\nYour Rating\nclose\n10 stars\n9 stars\n8 stars\n7 stars\n6 stars\n5 stars\n4 stars\n3 stars\n2 stars\n1 star\nRate Now\n0\n/10\nYour comment has not been saved\nLike\nJurassic Park\nPG-13\nAdventure\nSci-Fi\nRelease Date\nJune 11, 1993\nRuntime\n127 minutes\nDirector\nSteven Spielberg\nWriters\nMichael Crichton, David Koepp\nProducers\nGerald R.

There's a reason almost every modern movie seems to feature 90s music—just slowed down and sung mournfully by a waif for some reason.\nBack then, I had my uncle record the music from the credits of films like\nThe Fifth Element\nand\nMen in Black\nfrom VHS to casette tape, and I still listen to many 90s movie soundtracks on services like Spotify to this day.\n7\nUnapologetically Weird Blockbusters\nTim Brookes / How-To Geek\nI know we get plenty of \"weird\" movies and shows these days, but they feel so\nsafe\ncompared to what came out in the 90s. I'm talking\nweird movies\nlike\nStrange Days, The Mask, Fear And Loathing in Las Vegas, Pi, Jacob's Ladder, Dark City\nand so many more. If you have any issues with existential dread, you probably want to give this decade a skip.\nYour Rating\nclose\n10 stars\n9 stars\n8 stars\n7 stars\n6 stars\n5 stars\n4 stars\n3 stars\n2 stars\n1 star\nRate Now\n0\n/10\nYour comment has not been saved\nLike\nDark City\nR\nMystery\nSci-Fi\nRelease Date\nFebruary 27, 1998\nRuntime\n100 minutes\nDirector\nAlex Proyas\nWriters\nAlex Proyas, David S.

There's a dream-like quality to these movies that no other era has quite managed to replicate.\n5\nMovie Stars Actually Mattered\nSydney Louw Butler / StudioCanal / How-To Geek\nI can't help but remember the 90s not just as a time of iconic and singular movies, but also as a time driven by the personality of the actors themselves. These days, I don't think actors play quite as much of a role in a movie's marketing or personality, but in the 90s names like Stallone, Van Damme, or (believe it or not) Segal would share almost equal movie poster real estate with the actual title of the film.\n4\nGenre Blending and \"Cool' Aesthetics Were the Norm\nIt's a tradition that's lived on, but the 90s really was a wonderful time for genre-blending and experimentation with tropes that had become stale over the course of the 20th century. We got horror-comedies, action sci-fi, and plenty of other interesting mashups. It was also the peak of that \"90s cool\" genre, with movies like\nBlade\nand\nThe Matrix\nexemplifying the leather and shades aesthetic.\n3\nMid-Budget Blockbusters\nWhile it still happens today, it's pretty rare for mid-budget films to strike it big, and really is there even still a thing like a mid-budget movie these days? The 90s had plenty of examples of movies that didn't cost a lot to make, but became huge profitable hits. Now, it seems that studios are spending more money than ever on big-budget films and barely breaking even after marketing and cinema cuts of tickets are taken into account.\nIn the 90s, we had movies like\nPretty Woman, Home Alone, Kindergarden Cop,\nand, of course, the first movie I ever saw in a cinema—\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\nWhich, for years, was the most profitable indie movie in history. These movies cost modest amounts of money to make, but were amazing works that were rewarded prodigiously.\nIf you look at our this list from our friensd over at Screen Rant with the\nhighest-grossing movies of the 2010s\n, those titles probably all individually cost as much to make as the top ten mid-budget 90s movie list combined.\n2\nPre-Internet Plot Logic\nIn the 90s, most people didn't have a smartphone. They didn't have home internet access, and there was no rescue drone coming for you. These realities made it easier to write good stories in genres like horror or suspense, which just won't work anymore in modern times. There's a reason horror films now tend to be set before all of these convenient technologies made these plots untenable. The only alternative is to find some reason for all of your character's phones to stop working in the first five minutes of the film.\n1\nThe Trailer Voice Guy\nThey just don't make movie trailers like they used to. Not only do modern trailers boldly\nspoil the entire movie plot\n, they take themselves way too seriously. Case in point, the \"In a world...\" movie voice is pretty much gone. Don't know what I'm talking about, have a listen to one of my favorite trailers of all time—\nTomorrow Never Dies\n.\nNow\nthat\nis how you tease a movie and explain just enough of the plot to make it interesting. I need us to have a dude with an overly dramatic voice anti-ASMR movie details right into my earholes. We've definttely left some things behind in the 90s that need to come back!\nStreaming\nHistory\nFollow\nFollowed\nLike\nShare\nFacebook\nX\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nFlipboard\nCopy link\nEmail\nReaders like you help support How-To Geek.

They often ignore, misunderstand, or underuse them. If you work with Excel spreadsheets regularly, those F-keys can be your secret weapon for working faster, smarter, and with far less frustration.\nMost function-key shortcuts also work in Google Sheets, but you may need to\nenable compatible spreadsheet shortcuts\nfrom the Help menu to access some familiar Excel shortcuts. You can also assign custom shortcuts to macros.\n12\nF1 – Help Center Access\nWhile working in Excel, there are times when you try to build a formula but can't quite remember the syntax or what a specific argument does. Your first instinct might be to open a web browser and search for an answer, but there's a much faster, more integrated way. Press F1, and Excel's Help pane appears instantly.\nThe best part is that this help is context-sensitive. If you select a cell containing a\nVLOOKUP function\nand press F1, Excel shows the help article specifically for VLOOKUP, complete with syntax, detailed descriptions of each argument, and examples.\n11\nF2 – Edit Active Cell\nThis shortcut might be basic, but it's one of the most effective if you love working through the keyboard and don't use a mouse. Simply select the cell you want to edit and press the F2 key. The cell immediately enters edit mode, placing the cursor at the end of the content.\nYou can instantly start typing to add more information, or use the arrow keys to move the cursor for precise edits. It's a small change that makes a huge difference in speed when you make lots of small adjustments across a sheet.\n10\nF3 – Paste Defined Names\nIf you're not using\nnamed ranges in your Excel spreadsheets\n, you're missing out on something useful. Named ranges make formulas far more readable and manageable. For example, instead of referencing cryptic cell addresses like A1:A100, you can use descriptive names like SalesData or ExpenseCategories.\nWhen you're writing a formula and need to insert a named range, press F3. This opens the Paste Name dialog box, which displays a neat list of all the named ranges in your workbook.\nSelect the one you want, click OK, and Excel inserts it perfectly into your formula. This eliminates guesswork, prevents typos, and ensures your formulas are accurate.\n9\nF4 – Repeat Last Action\nIf you apply a format to a cell and want to repeat it across others without redoing the whole process, use F4. For example, if you bold a heading, select the next heading and hit F4—it's bolded instantly. This works for many actions, including formatting and inserting rows or columns. It's a low-effort way to be more efficient.\nIn formulas, F4 also toggles reference types. Writing\n=B1+C1\n, but need B1 locked? Place the cursor on B1, tap F4, and it cycles through $B$1, B$1, $B1, and back to B1. This gives you fine control over your references without manually adding dollar signs.\n8\nF5 – Go To Any Cell or Range\nIn a large worksheet, scrolling to find a specific cell or range wastes time. With the F5 shortcut, you can quickly navigate anywhere in your sheet. Press F5 to bring up the Go-To box, where you can enter cell references, named ranges, or even jump to specific features like comments or formulas.\nThe dialog also shows a list of recently visited locations, making it easy to bounce between areas of your spreadsheet. Plus, the Special button adds even more power, letting you select cells based on their properties—such as all formulas, all blank cells, or all cells with conditional formatting.\nThis is incredibly useful for auditing your work or performing bulk edits.\n7\nF6 – Cycle Through Panes\nYour Excel window contains several distinct areas: the ribbon at the top, the worksheet grid, the sheet tabs at the bottom, and the status bar. If you've used the Split view, you have even more panes.\nPress F6 to jump between these panes without using your mouse. Each press moves your focus to the next area, letting you use arrow keys or other shortcuts to navigate within it.\n6\nF7 – Run Spell Check\nSpelling still matters—even in spreadsheets. If your file includes labels, comments, or notes, use F7 to run a\nquick spell check\n.\nIt scans your active worksheet, including cell values, comments, headers, and even text within charts, for potential typos and offers correction suggestions.\n5\nF8 – Activate Extend Mode\nNormally, selecting a range of cells with the keyboard involves holding down Shift while pressing the arrow keys. F8 offers an alternative. Press F8 once to turn on Extend Mode (you'll see it noted in the status bar). Now you can release the key. Each time you press an arrow key, the selection expands from your starting cell.\nYou can also click another cell to instantly select the entire rectangular range between your starting point and your click. Press F8 again or Esc to turn the mode off. The real advantage emerges when you need to select irregular ranges or when precision matters more than speed.\n4\nF9 – Recalculate Workbooks\nBy default,\nExcel recalculates formulas\nautomatically whenever a dependent cell changes. In large, complex workbooks, this can cause noticeable lag. Switching to Manual Calculation mode prevents automatic updates, letting you choose when recalculations happen.\nPress F9 to update every formula in all open workbooks, Shift+F9 to update only the active sheet, or select a specific range and press F9 to recalculate just that part. This control is especially useful with volatile functions, complex array formulas, or data linked to external sources—cases where recalculation is resource-intensive.\nBy batching edits and triggering calculations only when needed, you can work more efficiently and avoid constant slowdowns.\n3\nF10 – Show Menu Bar Access Keys\nF10 reveals access keys for ribbon commands, creating keyboard shortcuts for virtually any spreadsheet function.\nPress F10, and small letters appear over each ribbon tab and quick access toolbar item. Alt+H takes you to the Home tab, Alt+N to Insert, and so on. Once in a tab, additional letters appear for specific commands, allowing you to execute them entirely from the keyboard.\nMicrosoft\nMicrosoft Excel\nShortcuts\nFollow\nFollowed\nLike\nShare\nFacebook\nX\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nFlipboard\nCopy link\nEmail\nReaders like you help support How-To Geek.
