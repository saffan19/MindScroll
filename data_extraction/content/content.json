    "content": "The attorney general of Louisiana has filed a lawsuit against Roblox, accusing the platform of failing to implement basic safety controls and making the site the “perfect place for pedophiles.”\n\nThe lawsuit, filed on Thursday by Attorney General Liz Murrill, alleges that Roblox “has and continues to facilitate the distribution of child sexual abuse material and the sexual exploitation of Louisiana’s children.” It also accuses the platform of purposely not rolling out basic safety controls to protect children from predators and failing to notify parents of risks.\n\nRoblox, which launched in 2006, has 82 million daily active users. The lawsuit notes that 20% of these users are under the age of 8, whereas another 20% are between the ages of 9 and 12.\n\n“Due to Roblox’s lack of safety protocols, it endangers the safety of the children of Louisiana,” Murrill said in a statement. “Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety. Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger poised to their children by Roblox so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home.”\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, adults can pose as children on Roblox, and children can bypass age requirements to access experiences meant for older users.\n\nThe lawsuit points to several sexually explicit experiences that were on the platform, including “Escape to Epstein Island,” “Diddy Party,” and “Public Bathroom Simulator Vibe.”\n\nA spokesperson for Roblox said that while the company can’t comment on pending litigation, the platform dedicates “substantial resources, including advanced technology and 24/7 human moderation, to help detect and prevent inappropriate content and behavior, including attempts to direct users off platform, where safety standards and moderation may be less stringent than ours.”\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\n“While no system is perfect, Roblox has implemented rigorous technology and enforcement safeguards, including restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing,” the spokesperson said. “The safety of our community is a top priority.”\n\nLast year, Roblox launched a number of safety measures to protect children on its platform, including barring users under the age of 13 from sending direct messages. The measures were implemented following reports that Roblox was exposing young users to dangerous risks, such as grooming and explicit content.\n\nMurrill’s lawsuit states that Roblox’s recent safety measures were implemented too late and are inadequate.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks permanent injunctive relief, prohibiting the company from claiming that it has adequate safety features and from engaging in any activity that would violate the Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Act.",

Tom Cotton wrote to Intel’s board asking about Tan’s alleged ties to China.\n\nTan met with the Trump administration on August 11 to quell the administration’s fears and figure out ways for the company to work with the government. This meeting is what sparked discussions of the U.S. government taking a direct stake in the company, according to Bloomberg.\n\nIntel declined to comment.\n\n“Intel is deeply committed to supporting President Trump’s efforts to strengthen U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership,” an Intel spokesperson said in a statement. “We look forward to continuing our work with the Trump Administration to advance these shared priorities, but we are not going to comment on rumors or speculation.”\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

    "content": "Is the grass greener on the other side? We’re not sure, but the sky is most certainly bluer. It’s been over two years since Elon Musk purchased Twitter, now X, leading people to set up shop on alternative platforms. Mastodon, Post, Pebble (two of which have already shuttered operations) and Spill have been presented as potential replacements, but few aside from Meta’s Threads have achieved the speed of growth Bluesky has reached.\n\nAs of February 2025, Bluesky has surpassed 30 million users. Its growth stems from several policy changes at X, including a heavily criticized change to the block feature and allowing third party companies to train their AI on users’ posts, which helped the app soar to the top of the U.S. App Store. Bluesky also saw a big boost following the results of the 2024 U.S. presidential election (which also contributed to an X exodus by Taylor Swift fans). But while the number is promising, the growth has slowed — and the network has a lot of catching up to do to compete with Threads’ 275 million monthly active users.\n\nBelow, we’ve compiled the answers to some of the most common questions users have about Bluesky. And if you’ve made the switch, you can follow TechCrunch here as well as our team with our Starter Pack.\n\nWhat is Bluesky?\n\nBluesky is a decentralized social app conceptualized by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and developed in parallel with Twitter. The social network has a Twitter-like user interface with algorithmic choice, a federated design and community-specific moderation.\n\nBluesky is using an open source framework built in-house, the AT Protocol, meaning people outside of the company have transparency into how it is built and what is being developed.\n\nDorsey introduced the Bluesky project back in 2019 while he was still Twitter CEO. At the time, he said Twitter would be funding a “small independent team of up to five open source architects, engineers, and designers,” charged with building a decentralized standard for social media, with the original goal that Twitter would adopt this standard itself. But that was before Elon Musk bought the platform, so Bluesky is completely divorced from X.\n\nAs of May 2024, Dorsey is no longer on Bluesky’s board. Bluesky is now an independent public benefit corporation led by CEO Jay Graber.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nHow do you use Bluesky?\n\nUpon signing up, users can create a handle which is then represented as @username.bsky.social as well as a display name that appears more prominent in bold text. If you’re so inclined, you can turn a domain name that you own into your username — so, for example, I’m known on Bluesky as @amanda.omg.lol.\n\nThe app itself functions much like X, where you can click a plus button to create a post of 256 characters, which can also include photos. Posts themselves can be replied to, retweeted, liked and, from a three-dot menu, reported, shared via the iOS Share Sheet to other apps, or copied as text.\n\nYou can search for and follow other individuals, then view their updates in your “Home” timeline. Previously, the Bluesky app would feature popular posts in a “What’s Hot” feed. That feed has since been replaced with an algorithmic and personalized “Discover” feed featuring more than just trending content.\n\nFor new users, Bluesky introduced a “Starter Pack” feature, which creates a curated list of people and custom feeds to follow in order to find interesting content right out of the gate. You can find TechCrunch’s Starter Pack right here.\n\nUser profiles contain the same sort of features you’d expect: a profile pic, background, bio, metrics and how many people they’re following. Profile feeds are divided into two sections, like X: posts and posts & replies. In January 2025, Bluesky also added a new video tab to user profiles.\n\nThere is also a “Discover” tab in the bottom center of the app’s navigation, which offers more “who to follow” suggestions and a running feed of recently posted Bluesky updates. In January 2025, Bluesky also introduced a vertical video feed to compete with TikTok.\n\nWe’ve also put together a helpful guide on how to use Bluesky here.\n\nImage Credits: Natalie Christman\n\nWho’s on Bluesky?\n\nBy the beginning of July 2023, when Instagram’s Threads launched, Bluesky topped a million downloads across iOS and Android. Notable figures like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Mark Cuban, Quinta Brunson, Dril, Weird Al Yankovic, Guillermo del Toro, Barbra Streisand, and Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva have migrated to Bluesky.\n\nBluesky is also home to news organizations like Bloomberg, The Washington Post, and of course, TechCrunch! Since August 2024, Bluesky is also now allowing heads of state to sign up and join the platform for the first time.\n\nIn 2025, some prominent U.S. political figures set up accounts on the platform, like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.\n\nDoes Bluesky work just like X?\n\nIn many ways, yes. When it first started, Bluesky was much more pared down and didn’t even have DMs, but this key feature has since been implemented, even with emoji reactions. But DMs on Bluesky are currently limited to one-to-one messages, not group messages. Bluesky has also said it is interested in implementing something similar to X’s Community Notes feature. Additionally, X does not use a decentralized protocol like ActivityPub or AT. Bluesky has also been testing a Trending Topics feature and developing its own photo sharing app called Flashes, which is expected to be released in beta soon.\n\nIn October 2024, Elon Musk announced that X’s block feature would work differently than it has in the past. The new block functionality allows users you have blocked to view your posts and your profile, but not the ability to interact with your posts. Some users believe this update to be a safety concern, leading to an influx in Bluesky sign-ups as its block feature is more traditional.\n\nIn another move that separates Bluesky from X, the social network said it has “no intention” of using user content to train generative AI tools as X implemented a new terms of service that allows the platform to train AI models on public posts. But that doesn’t stop third parties from doing so.\n\nWhile Bluesky was initially kicked off as a project convened by Jack Dorsey in 2019 when he was CEO of Twitter, the social app has been an independent company since its inception in 2021.\n\nIs Bluesky free?\n\nYes, and it is now open to the public.\n\nHow does Bluesky make money?\n\nBluesky’s goal is to find another means to sustain its network outside of advertising with paid services, so it can remain free to end users. On July 5, 2023, Bluesky announced additional seed round funding and a paid service that provides custom domains for end users who want to have a unique domain as their handle on the service. Bluesky has also emphasized that it does not want to “require selling user data for ads” in order to monetize its platform.\n\nIn November 2024, Bluesky announced it raised a $15 million Series A round and is developing a subscription service for premium features. Bluesky, however, noted its subscription model will not follow in the footsteps of X’s “pay to win” premium offerings. Users have spotted mockups teasing the subscription feature, dubbed Bluesky+, which could include features like higher quality video uploads and profile customizations.\n\nIn December 2024, Peter Wang announced a $1 million fund, dubbed Skyseed, that will offer grants to those building on Bluesky’s open source AT Protocol.\n\nIs Bluesky decentralized?\n\nYes. Bluesky’s team is developing the decentralized AT Protocol, which Bluesky was built atop. In its beta phase, users can only join the bsky.social network, but Bluesky plans to be federated, meaning that endless individually operated communities can exist within the open source network. So, if a developer outside of Bluesky built their own new social app using the AT Protocol, Bluesky users could jump over to the new app and port over their existing followers, handle and data.\n\n“You’ll always have the freedom to choose (and to exit) instead of being held to the whims of private companies or black box algorithms. And wherever you go, your friends and relationships will be there too,” a Bluesky blog post explained.\n\nWhat third-party apps are built on the AT Protocol?\n\nMany developers are building consumer-facing apps on Bluesky or its underlying AT Protocol. These apps are built on open technology, as opposed to being siloed within big tech’s centralized, opaque ownership.\n\nSome social apps include Flashes, a photo viewing client; Spark, a TikTok-like app; and Skylight Social, which is backed by Mark Cuban.\n\nCheck out our more comprehensive list at various apps built within this ecosystem, including cross-posting apps, music apps, feed builders, and livestreamers.\n\nIs Bluesky secure?\n\nIn October 2023, Bluesky added email verification as part of a larger effort to improve account security and authentication on the network. The addition is an important step forward in terms of making Bluesky more competitive with larger networks like X, which have more robust security controls. In December 2023, Bluesky allowed users to opt out of a change that would expose their posts to the public web following backlash from users.\n\nIs Bluesky customizable?\n\nYes. In May 2023, Bluesky released custom algorithms, which it calls “custom feeds.” Custom feeds allow users to subscribe to multiple different algorithms that showcase different kinds of posts a user may want to see. You can pin custom feeds that will show up at the top of your timeline as different tabs to pick from. The feeds you pin, or save, are located under the “My Feeds” menu in the app’s sidebar.\n\nIn March 2024,​​ the company announced “AT Protocol Grants,” a new program that will dole out small grants to developers in order to foster growth and customization. One of the recipients, SkyFeed, is a custom tool that lets anyone build their own feeds using a graphical user interface.\n\nIs Bluesky on iOS and Android?\n\nYes. Bluesky has rolled out to Android users after it was initially launched to iOS users. Users can access Bluesky on the web here.\n\nHow does Bluesky tackle misinformation?\n\nAfter an October 2023 update, the app will now warn users of misleading links by flagging them. If links shared in users’ posts don’t match their text, the app will offer a “possibly misleading” warning to the user to alert them that the link may be directing them somewhere they don’t want to go.\n\nImage Credits: Bluesky on GitHub Image Credits:Bluesky on Github\n\nIn December 2024, the Bluesky Safety team posted that the company updated its impersonation policy to be “more aggressive,” adding that “impersonation and handle-squatting accounts will be removed.” The company said it is also exploring alternatives to its current domain handle verification process.\n\nHas Bluesky had any controversies?\n\nBluesky has been embattled with moderation issues since its first launch. The app has been accused of failing to protect its marginalized users and failing to moderate racist content. Following a controversy about the app allowing racial slurs in account handles, frustrated users initiated a “posting strike,” where they refused to engage with the platform until it established guardrails to flag slurs and other offensive terms in usernames.\n\nIn December 2024, Bluesky also faced criticism when writer and podcast host Jesse Singal joined the platform. Singal has been cataloged by GLAAD’s Accountability Project for his writings on transgender issues and other matters. Bluesky users have reported Singal’s account en masse, leading the company to ban him, reinstate him, and then label his account intolerant by its moderation service.\n\nWhat moderation features does Bluesky have?\n\nIn December 2023, Bluesky rolled out “more advanced automated tooling” designed to flag content that violates its Community Guidelines that will then be reviewed by the app’s moderation team. Bluesky has moderation features similar to ones on X, including user lists and moderation lists, and a feature that lets users limit who can reply to posts. However, some Bluesky users are still advocating for the ability to set their accounts to private.\n\nIn March 2024, the company launched Ozone, a tool that lets users create and run their own independent moderation services that will give users “unprecedented control” over their social media experience. In October 2024, Bluesky joined Instragram’s Threads app in an effort to court users who were frustrated by Meta’s moderation issues.\n\nIn January 2025, Bluesky published its 2024 moderation report that said it saw a 17x increase in moderation reports following the rapid growth on the platform. The report also noted that the largest number of reports came from users reporting accounts or posts for harassment, trolling, or intolerance — an issue that’s plagued Bluesky as it’s grown. To meet the demands caused by this growth, Bluesky increased its moderation team to roughly 100 moderators and will continue to hire.\n\nBluesky revamped its Community Guidelines in August 2025, with some of the changes representing an effort by Bluesky to purposefully shape its community and the behavior of its users.\n\nWhat’s the difference between Bluesky and Mastodon?\n\nThough Bluesky’s architecture is similar to Mastodon’s, many users have found Bluesky to be more intuitive, while Mastodon can come off as inaccessible: Choosing which instance to join feels like an impossible task on Mastodon, and longtime users are very defensive about their established posting norms, which can make joining the conversation intimidating. To remain competitive, Mastodon recently simplified its sign-up flow, making mastodon.social the default server for new users.\n\nHowever, the launch of federation will make it work more similarly to Mastodon in that users can pick and choose which servers to join and move their accounts around at will.\n\nWho owns Bluesky?\n\nThough Jack Dorsey funded Bluesky, he is not involved in day-to-day development and no longer sits on the company’s board. The CEO of Bluesky is Jay Graber, who previously worked as a software engineer for the cryptocurrency Zcash, then founded an event-planning site called Happening.\n\nIf you have more FAQs about Bluesky not covered here, leave us a comment below.\n\nThis story was originally published in May 2023 and is updated regularly with new information.",

    "content": "Two years after launching, social network Bluesky is revising its Community Guidelines and other policies, and asking for feedback from its users on some of the changes. The startup, a competitor to X, Threads, and open networks like Mastodon, says its new policies are meant to offer improved clarity and more detail around its user safety procedures and the appeals process.\n\nMany of the changes are being driven by new global regulations, including the U.K.’s Online Safety Act (OSA), the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), and the U.S.’s TAKE IT DOWN Act.\n\nSome of the changes represent an effort by Bluesky to purposefully shape its community and the behavior of its users, nudging them to be nicer and more respectful of others. This comes after a series of complaints and media articles suggesting the community has a tendency toward self-seriousness, bad-news sharing, and a lack of humor and diversity of thought.\n\nFor regulatory compliance, Bluesky’s Terms of Service has been updated to comply with online safety laws and regulations and to require age assurance where required. For instance, in July, the U.K.’s Online Safety Act began requiring that platforms with adult content implement age verification, which means Bluesky users in the country have to either scan their face, upload their ID, or enter a payment card to use the site.\n\nThe process for complaints and appeals is also now more detailed.\n\nOne notable update references an “informal dispute resolution process,” where Bluesky agrees to talk on the phone with a user about their dispute before any formal dispute process takes place. “We think most disputes can be resolved informally,” Bluesky notes.\n\nThat’s quite different from what’s taking place at larger social networks, like Facebook and Instagram, where users are being banned without any understanding of what they did wrong and no way to get in touch with the company to complain.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nBluesky also says it will allow users to resolve certain claims of harm in court, instead of through arbitration. This is also somewhat unusual for tech companies that often prefer to mediate disputes outside the courts.\n\nHowever, Bluesky users may be more interested in the proposed changes to the Community Guidelines, which they’re invited to offer feedback about. (The changes go into effect October 15, 2025, after the feedback period completes.)\n\nThese revised guidelines are organized around four principles: Safety First, Respect Others, Be Authentic, and Follow the Rules. These general principles are meant to guide Bluesky’s moderation decisions around whether content should be labeled or removed, if the company can suspend or ban your account, or, in some cases, report you to law enforcement.\n\nBluesky’s rules include many common-sense policies around not promoting violence or harm (including self-harm and animal abuse); not posting content that’s illegal or that sexualizes minors (including in role-play); not allowing harmful actions like doxxing and other nonconsensual personal data-sharing; and not posting spam or malicious content, among other things.\n\nIt carves out provisions for journalism, parody, and satire. For instance, journalists engaged in “factual reporting” can post about criminal acts and violence, mental health, online safety, and other topics, like warnings of online viral challenges that may be harmful.\n\nWhere Bluesky may get into trouble is with the nuances of what’s considered a “threat,” “harm,” or “abuse.”\n\nThe policy states that users should “respect others” by not posting, promoting, or encouraging “hate, harassment, or bullying.” As an example, the policy bans exploitive deepfakes and content that “incites discrimination or hatred,” meaning posts that attack individuals or groups based on “race, ethnicity, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, or other protected traits.”\n\nThis is an area where Bluesky has faltered before, when, in earlier days, its moderation decisions strained its relationship with the Black community, and in another case, when its failure to moderate angered the trans community.\n\nMore recently, the company has been facing backlash that it’s become too left-leaning, where users were quick to criticize, post hateful replies, and where the community generally lacked humor.\n\nThe original idea behind Bluesky was to provide users with tools to create the community they want, including not only blocking and reporting tools, but also things like subscribable block lists or opt-in moderation services that align with your values. However, Bluesky users have still shown a preference for the app itself to handle much of the moderation, railing against its trust and safety department when it made decisions they disagreed with.\n\nIn addition, Bluesky’s Privacy Policy and Copyright Policy were also rewritten to comply with global laws around user rights, data transfer, retention and deletion, takedown procedures, transparency reporting, and more. These both go into effect on September 15, 2025, and there is no feedback period for either.",

    "content": "Cohere on Thursday announced that it had raised an oversubscribed $500 million round, bringing its valuation to $6.8 billion. This is up from the $5.5 billion valuation it landed a little over a year ago when it raised its previous round, also $500 million.\n\nToronto-headquartered Cohere was one of the first breakout LLM model makers, founded in 2019 by co-founder Aidan Gomez, one of the authors of the “Attention Is All You Need” paper that became the foundation of modern AI. But it has been a sleeper entrant in the AI model wars of late, dominated by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta. Its market proposition, however, has always been to offer secure LLMs specifically geared for enterprise use, not for consumers.\n\nTo that end, it’s landed partnerships with some of the biggest names in enterprise tech, including Oracle, Dell, Bell, Fujitsu, LG’s consulting service CNS, and SAP, as well as some big enterprise names like RBC and a new investor in this round: Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan.\n\nIts press release even includes a jibe, stating that Cohere “represents a security-first category of enterprise AI that is simply not being met by repurposed consumer models.”\n\nStill, as TechCrunch reported, Cohere is not above the AI talent-poaching frenzy that has engulfed the other AI companies. It just nabbed long-time Meta research head Joelle Pineau to be its chief AI officer. It also hired a new CFO, Francois Chadwick, away from his consulting gig at KPMG. He had worked in finance at Uber and as CFO at Shield AI.\n\nThe new round was led by Radical Ventures and Inovia Capital. Radical has backed companies like Fei-Fei Li’s World Labs, as well as names like Hebbia and Writer. Inovia is a known Canadian venture firm (e.g., portfolio includes Poolside, Neo4j).\n\nThe round included participation from existing investors, including AMD Ventures, Nvidia, and Salesforce Ventures, although, interestingly enough, the company did not name Oracle as an ongoing participating investor.

Apple’s hardware event is expected to take place in September.\n\nThe tech giant has made its intentions clear to grow the Pixel line, likely incorporating more generative AI capabilities with Gemini. Made by Google will be at 10 a.m. PT on August 20.\n\nGet ready for a Gemini boost\n\nImage Credits:Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket / Getty Images\n\nGoogle already dropped several AI-related updates at its developer conference in May, but the company will likely demonstrate more Gemini features during the Pixel 10 event. In a recent YouTube video promoting the new devices, Google even seemed to poke fun at Apple’s failed promises with Apple Intelligence advancements on the iPhone.\n\nRumors are buzzing about a feature called “Camera Coach,” which would let Gemini give you real-time tips for taking better photos. The AI is supposedly able to see what’s going on and suggest the best angles and lighting for your shot.\n\nThere’s also talk of a conversational photo editing tool, where you tell Gemini what you want to tweak in a photo, such as increasing the brightness, removing objects, or changing the background.\n\nPixel 10, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL\n\nThe standard Pixel 10 phone is expected to undergo significant changes, particularly with the addition of a dedicated telephoto lens, a feature that was previously exclusive to the Pro models. Following the leak of renders showcasing the third rear lens, Google released a teaser for the Pixel 10, confirming the substantial camera upgrade.\n\nAdditionally, all phones in the lineup are expected to be powered by a new Tensor G5 processor, ushering in the Gemini era and enhancing performance and power efficiency compared to the Tensor G4 chip.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

The basic design of the phones will likely remain similar to that of the Pixel 9 series. The displays are also expected to stay the same, with the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro featuring a 6.3-inch display, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL with a larger 6.8-inch display.\n\nSome areas where the Pro models may see improvement are camera and video quality, along with battery size, which could allow for faster charging and could address the longevity gap between Pixel and flagship phones from Apple and Samsung.\n\nPlus, there is talk that the Pixel 10 series could support Qi2 wireless charging. If true, this means it would be one of the few Android phones to work with magnetic accessories, such as chargers, wallets, and mounts. Google is also reportedly launching a “Pixelsnap” phone case with a magnetic ring in the center.\n\nPixel 10 Pro Fold\n\nAs for Google’s upcoming foldable, there are rumors suggesting it’ll have a larger cover display, measuring at around 6.4 inches, alongside an 8-inch main screen. Additionally, Google is reportedly enhancing the strength of the hinge, and the bezels are expected to be thinner for a sleek appearance.\n\nAnother exciting rumor is the possibility of an IP68 rating, a first for the device. This means it can stand up to both dust and water, whereas the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has zero dust protection.\n\nLike the other Pixel 10 phones, the Pro Fold will likely be powered by the new G5 chip and include the latest Gemini AI features. The camera system might also receive improvements, potentially featuring a 48-megapixel ultra-wide lens and a telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom. The phone should also likely get a bump in battery life.\n\nThe Pixel 10 may come in Moonstone and Jade colors.\n\nThe Pixel Watch and Pixel Buds\n\nImage Credits:Google\n\nWearables will also get their time to shine at Google’s event, with the Pixel Watch 4 rumored to get a thicker design, a longer battery life, and smaller bezels.\n\nThere’s also a strong likelihood that the smartwatch will introduce new health and fitness-tracking capabilities, possibly including an upgraded blood oxygen (SpO2) monitoring function.\n\nLeaks of the Pixel Buds 2a indicate that the earbuds will come in new colors (Fog Light, Hazel, Iris, and Strawberry) along with features like active noise cancellation. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 will also reportedly come in a new Sterling color.\n\nThis story has been updated to include additional rumors.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

    "content": "Apple usually announces its new hardware in the fall, and this year is likely no different. The event is reported to be on September 9, and Apple is expected to release its iPhone 17 lineup, along with updates for the Apple Watch and AirPods.\n\nAs always, there are many rumors circulating, including bigger screens and improved cameras for the iPhone 17 models and the introduction of an ultra-thin iPhone Air that could replace the Plus model.\n\niPhone 17, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max\n\nThe iPhone 17 is expected to get a significant makeover to align more closely with the Pro models. It could feature a slightly larger 6.3-inch screen, which is an increase of 0.2 inches compared to the iPhone 16, as well as a 120Hz display, a substantial upgrade from the current 60Hz. It’s also rumored to have a 24-megapixel front camera. It could also come in new colors: purple and green.\n\niPhone 17: Purple and Green Colors in Testing as Potential New Shade for 2025\n\n\n\nFull Article:https://t.co/jZJJoUHBsf pic.twitter.com/1in8R6dDa5 — Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) June 20, 2025\n\nThe Pro’s upgrades will be noticeable on the back of the phone, rumors suggest. Conceptual renderings show that the three rear cameras may be arranged in a rectangular bar that extends from one edge of the device to the other. The flash, light sensor, and microphone would be positioned far to the right side. Where the MagSafe charger is, the Apple logo is said to be centered for aesthetic reasons.\n\nNotably, the iPhone 17 Pro may switch materials, potentially replacing the titanium band around the screen with aluminum. This could help Apple reduce costs as well as provide a lighter feel.\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to see fewer upgrades, too, with the most significant change being a slightly thicker body, likely to accommodate a larger battery — which would be a huge win.\n\nAccording to leaker Instant Digital, the iPhone 17 is predicted to be priced around $800, and the Pro Max is expected to have a price tag of $1,250.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nThe Pro model is expected to be priced around $1,050. However, a recent leak indicates that there will be fewer storage options compared to the 16 Pro. Users may lose the 128GB option and will only have three choices: 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB, down from the typical four options.\n\niPhone Air\n\nImage Credits:Apple Track\n\nThe most widely discussed rumor is that Apple might be introducing its slimmest phone ever, the iPhone Air, which may replace the iPhone Plus.\n\nThis rumored device is said to have a profile thickness of 5.5 mm, making it about 0.08 inches thinner than current iPhones. It’ll also feature a 6.6-inch screen.\n\nThis move appears to be Apple’s response to the trend of slimmer smartphones, following in the footsteps of other companies like Samsung and Huawei. The iPhone Air could potentially outshine the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, which measures 5.8 mm thick. Additionally, it may pave the way for Apple’s long-rumored foldable phone, predicted to launch in September 2026.\n\nWhile the thin design is stylish, it would come with some compromises. Based on the renders we’ve seen, the Air is expected to have only one rear camera lens, unlike the Plus, which has two. There are also rumors that there may not be enough space for a speaker at the bottom, meaning the only audio source could be the front earpiece at the top.\n\nReports suggest the device will be priced at $950 and will be available in black, silver, and light gold.\n\nApple Watch Series 11, Ultra 3, and SE 3\n\nImage Credits:Apple\n\nAfter a two-year wait, there are various rumors surrounding the Apple Watch Ultra 3, suggesting it will undergo significant changes. These may include faster charging speeds, 5G support, and satellite connectivity. Additionally, it’s speculated that the watch will feature a larger display.\n\nOne of the most exciting potential upgrades for both the Ultra 3 and Series 11 is the incorporation of blood pressure monitoring capabilities. This feature would notify users if their blood pressure levels are too high or too low. Apple is also considering adding a sleep apnea feature. However, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the company may need to delay the release of these features for further tweaks.\n\nApple recently announced that a redesigned blood oxygen feature is rolling out to some Series 8, 10, and Ultra watches. This leads us to think the Ultra 3 may also get the capability, but the company didn’t mention if it would be available in the watchOS 26 in its announcement.\n\nThe third generation of Apple Watch SE isn’t expected to receive major updates, aside from possibly a larger display. There continue to be reports of a plastic version being introduced, according to Gurman.\n\nRumored prices for the watches are: $250 for the Apple Watch SE 3, $400 for the Series 11, and $800 for the Ultra 3.\n\nAirPods Pro 3\n\nImage Credits:Apple\n\nAfter the release of the AirPods Pro 2 in 2022, it’s about time for an upgrade, and Apple might just be ready to deliver. Rumors suggest that the AirPods Pro 3 will feature a sleeker design, touch-sensitive controls, smaller earbuds, and a slimmer case. Additionally, the H3 chip is expected to enhance active noise cancellation and adaptive audio.\n\nThis story has been updated to include additional rumors.\n\n\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

    "content": "Eastman Kodak is denying reports that it’s shutting down.\n\nOn Wednesday, media outlets like CNN and CNBC detailed the company’s ongoing financial challenges, including statements made in its earnings report that warned investors it didn’t have “committed financing or available liquidity” to meet debt obligations coming due within 12 months.\n\nHowever, Kodak quickly published a press release to counter these claims, noting it has “no plans to cease operations” or file for bankruptcy protection. Rather, it claims to have plans to “repay, extend, or refinance” its debt before the due date and expects to have a stronger balance sheet by early next year.\n\nThe company also offered an explanation of its financials, noting it will use $300 million in cash it’s receiving in December 2025 from its pension plan termination to address a large portion of its $477 million in term debt. It will then address the remaining $177 million in debt and another $100 million in preferred stock outstanding.\n\nDespite these clarifications on recent issues, the 133-year-old company has regularly struggled with finances as digital technology eclipsed film sales. Kodak previously filed for bankruptcy in 2012. In recent years, however, some Gen Z users have embraced older tech, like compact cameras and dumb phones, as a way to tap into nostalgia for a time they never got to experience.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

    "content": "ChatGPT, OpenAI’s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.\n\n2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.\n\nOpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit.\n\nIn 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it’s ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.\n\nBelow, you’ll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we’ve been updating throughout the year.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nAugust 2025\n\nOpenAI keeps multiple GPT models despite GPT-5 launch\n\nDespite unveiling GPT-5 as a “one-size-fits-all” AI, OpenAI is still offering several legacy AI options, including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and o3. Users can choose between new “Auto,” “Fast,” and “Thinking” modes for GPT-5, and paid subscribers regain access to legacy models like GPT-4o and GPT-4.1.\n\nUpdates to ChatGPT:\n\n\n\nYou can now choose between “Auto”, “Fast”, and “Thinking” for GPT-5. Most users will want Auto, but the additional control will be useful for some people.\n\n\n\nRate limits are now 3,000 messages/week with GPT-5 Thinking, and then extra capacity on GPT-5 Thinking… — Sam Altman (@sama) August 13, 2025\n\nSam Altman addresses GPT-5 glitches and “chart crime” during Reddit AMA\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Reddit users that GPT-5’s “dumber” behavior at launch was due to a router issue and promised fixes, double rate limits for Plus users, and transparency on which model is answering, while also shrugging off the infamous “chart crime” from the live presentation.\n\nOpenAI unveils GPT-5, a smarter, task-ready ChatGPT\n\nOpenAI released GPT-5, a next-gen AI that’s not just smarter but more useful — able to handle tasks like coding apps, managing calendars, and creating research briefs — while automatically figuring out the fastest or most thoughtful way to answer your questions.\n\nOpenAI offers ChatGPT Enterprise to federal agencies for just $1\n\nOpenAI is making a major push into federal government workflows, offering ChatGPT Enterprise to agencies for just $1 for the next year. The move comes after the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) added OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to its approved AI vendor list, allowing agencies to access these tools through preset contracts without negotiating pricing.\n\nOpenAI returns to open source with new AI models\n\nOpenAI unveiled its first open source language models since GPT-2, introducing two new open-weight AI releases: gpt-oss-120b, a high-performance model capable of running on a single Nvidia GPU, and gpt-oss-20b, a lighter model optimized for laptop use. The move comes amid growing competition in the global AI market and a push for more open technology in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nChatGPT nears 700M weekly users, quadruples growth in a year\n\nChatGPT’s rapid growth is accelerating. OpenAI said the chatbot was on track to hit 700 million weekly active users in the first week of August, up from 500 million at the end of March. Nick Turley, OpenAI’s VP and head of the ChatGPT app, highlighted the app’s growth on X, noting it has quadrupled in size over the past year.\n\nThis week, ChatGPT is on track to reach 700M weekly active users — up from 500M at the end of March and 4× since last year. Every day, people and teams are learning, creating, and solving harder problems. Big week ahead. Grateful to the team for making ChatGPT more useful and… — Nick Turley (@nickaturley) August 4, 2025\n\nJuly 2025\n\nChatGPT now has study mode\n\nOpenAI unveiled Study Mode, a new ChatGPT feature designed to promote critical thinking by prompting students to engage with material rather than simply receive answers. The tool is now rolling out to Free, Plus, Pro, and Team users, with availability for Edu subscribers expected in the coming weeks.\n\nAltman warns that ChatGPT therapy isn’t confidential\n\nChatGPT users should be cautious when seeking emotional support from AI, as the AI industry lacks safeguards for sensitive conversations, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on a recent episode of This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von. Unlike human therapists, AI tools aren’t bound by doctor-patient confidentiality, he noted.\n\nChatGPT hits 2.5B prompts daily\n\nChatGPT now receives 2.5 billion prompts daily from users worldwide, including roughly 330 million from the U.S. That’s more than double the volume reported by CEO Sam Altman just eight months ago, highlighting the chatbot’s explosive growth.\n\nOpenAI launches a general-purpose agent in ChatGPT\n\nOpenAI has introduced ChatGPT Agent, which completes a wide variety of computer-based tasks on behalf of users and combines several capabilities like Operator and Deep Research, according to the company. OpenAI says the agent can automatically navigate a user’s calendar, draft editable presentations and slideshows, run code, shop online, and handle complex workflows from end to end, all within a secure virtual environment.\n\nStudy warns of major risks with AI therapy chatbots\n\nResearchers at Stanford University have observed that therapy chatbots powered by large language models can sometimes stigmatize people with mental health conditions or respond in ways that are inappropriate or could be harmful. While chatbots are “being used as companions, confidants, and therapists,” the study found “significant risks.”\n\nOpenAI delays releasing its open model again\n\nCEO Sam Altman said that the company is delaying the release of its open model, which had already been postponed by a month earlier this summer. The ChatGPT maker, which initially planned to release the model around mid-July, has indefinitely postponed its launch to conduct additional safety testing.\n\nwe planned to launch our open-weight model next week.\n\n\n\nwe are delaying it; we need time to run additional safety tests and review high-risk areas. we are not yet sure how long it will take us.\n\n\n\nwhile we trust the community will build great things with this model, once weights are… — Sam Altman (@sama) July 12, 2025\n\nOpenAI is reportedly releasing an AI browser in the coming weeks\n\nOpenAI plans to release an AI-powered web browser to challenge Alphabet’s Google Chrome. It will keep some user interactions within ChatGPT, rather than directing people to external websites.\n\nChatGPT is testing a mysterious new feature called “study together”\n\nSome ChatGPT users have noticed a new feature called “Study Together” appearing in their list of available tools. This is the chatbot’s approach to becoming a more effective educational tool, rather than simply providing answers to prompts. Some people also wonder whether there will be a feature that allows multiple users to join the chat, similar to a study group.\n\nReferrals from ChatGPT to news sites are rising but not enough to offset search declines\n\nReferrals from ChatGPT to news publishers are increasing. But this rise is insufficient to offset the decline in clicks as more users now obtain their news directly from AI or AI-powered search results, according to a report by digital market intelligence company Similarweb. Since Google launched its AI Overviews in May 2024, the percentage of news searches that don’t lead to clicks on news websites has increased from 56% to nearly 69% by May 2025.\n\nJune 2025\n\nOpenAI uses Google’s AI chips to power its products\n\nOpenAI has started using Google’s AI chips to power ChatGPT and other products, as reported by Reuters. The ChatGPT maker is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia’s GPUs, using the AI chips to train models, and this is the first time that OpenAI is using non-Nvidia chips in an important way.\n\nA new MIT study suggests that ChatGPT might be harming critical thinking skills\n\nResearchers from MIT’s Media Lab monitored the brain activity of writers in 32 regions. They found that ChatGPT users showed minimal brain engagement and consistently fell short in neural, linguistic, and behavioral aspects. To conduct the test, the lab split 54 participants from the Boston area into three groups, each consisting of individuals ages 18 to 39. The participants were asked to write multiple SAT essays using tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the Google search engine, or without any tools.\n\nChatGPT was downloaded 30 million times last month\n\nThe ChatGPT app for iOS was downloaded 29.6 million times in the last 28 days, while TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and X were downloaded a total of 32.9 million times during the same period, representing a difference of about 10.6%, according to ZDNET report citing Similarweb’s X post.\n\nThe energy needed for an average ChatGPT query can power a lightbulb for a couple of minutes\n\nSam Altman said that the average ChatGPT query uses about one-fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, equivalent to 0.000083 gallons of water, or the energy required to power a lightbulb for a few minutes, per Business Insider. In addition to that, the chatbot requires 0.34 watt-hours of electricity to operate.\n\nOpenAI has launched o3-pro, an upgraded version of its o3 AI reasoning model\n\nOpenAI has unveiled o3-pro, an enhanced version of its o3, a reasoning model that the chatGPT maker launched earlier this year. O3-pro is available for ChatGPT and Team users and in the API, while Enterprise and Edu users will get access in the third week of June.\n\nOpenAI o3-pro is available in the model picker for Pro and Team users starting today, replacing OpenAI o1-pro.\n\n\n\nEnterprise and Edu users will get access the week after.\n\n\n\nAs o3-pro uses the same underlying model as o3, full safety details can be found in the o3 system card.… — OpenAI (@OpenAI) June 10, 2025\n\nChatGPT’s conversational voice mode has been upgraded\n\nOpenAI upgraded ChatGPT’s conversational voice mood for all paid users across different markets and platforms. The startup has launched an update to Advanced Voice that enables users to converse with ChatGPT out loud in a more natural and fluid sound. The feature also helps users translate languages more easily, the comapny said.\n\nChatGPT has added new features like meeting recording and connectors for Google Drive, Box, and more\n\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT now offers new funtions for business users, including integrations with various cloud services, meeting recordings, and MCP connection support for connecting to tools for in-depth research. The feature enables ChatGPT to retrieve information across users’ own services to answer their questions. For instance, an analyst could use the company’s slide deck and documents to develop an investment thesis.\n\nMay 2025\n\nOpenAI CFO says hardware will drive ChatGPT’s growth\n\nOpenAI plans to purchase Jony Ive’s devices startup io for $6.4 billion. Sarah Friar, CFO of OpenAI, thinks that the hardware will significantly enhance ChatGPT and broaden OpenAI’s reach to a larger audience in the future.\n\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT unveils its AI coding agent, Codex\n\nOpenAI has introduced its AI coding agent, Codex, powered by codex-1, a version of its o3 AI reasoning model designed for software engineering tasks. OpenAI says codex-1 generates more precise and “cleaner” code than o3.

Aidan Clark, OpenAI’s VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.\n\nOpenAI’s GPT-4.1 may be less aligned than earlier models\n\nOpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company skipped that step — sending safety cards for GPT-4.1 — claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that “GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won’t be a separate system card released for it.”\n\nOpenAI’s o3 AI model scored lower than expected on a benchmark\n\nQuestions have been raised regarding OpenAI’s transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI’s top-reported score.\n\nOpenAI unveils Flex processing for cheaper, slower AI tasks\n\nOpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads.\n\nOpenAI’s latest AI models now have a safeguard against biorisks\n\nOpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in OpenAI’s safety report.\n\nOpenAI launches its latest reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini\n\nOpenAI has released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. But they hallucinate more than several of OpenAI’s previous models.\n\nOpenAI has added a new section to ChatGPT to offer easier access to AI-generated images for all user tiers\n\nOpen AI introduced a new section called “library” to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, per the company’s X post.\n\nAll of your image creations, all in one place.\n\n\n\nIntroducing the new library for your ChatGPT image creations—rolling out now to all Free, Plus, and Pro users on mobile and https://t.co/nYW5KO1aIg. pic.twitter.com/ADWuf5fPbj — OpenAI (@OpenAI) April 15, 2025\n\nOpenAI could “adjust” its safeguards if rivals release “high-risk” AI\n\nOpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition.\n\nOpenAI is building its own social media network\n\nOpenAI is currently in the early stages of developing its own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk’s X and Mark Zuckerberg’s Instagram and Threads, according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT.\n\nOpenAI will remove its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from the API, in July\n\nOpenAI will discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February.

The image generator was made available to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.\n\nOpenAI’s o3 model could cost more to run than initial estimate\n\nThe Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI’s o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.\n\nOpenAI CEO says capacity issues will cause product delays\n\nIn a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company’s new image-generation tool’s popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote.\n\nMarch 2025\n\nOpenAI plans to release a new ‘open’ AI language model\n\nOpeanAI intends to release its “first” open language model since GPT-2 “in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.\n\nOpenAI removes ChatGPT’s restrictions on image generation\n\nOpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI’s model behavior.\n\nOpenAI adopts Anthropic’s standard for linking AI models with data\n\nOpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said.\n\nOpenAI’s viral Studio Ghibli-style images could raise AI copyright concerns\n\nThe latest update of the image generator on OpenAI’s ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization.\n\nOpenAI expects revenue to triple to $12.7 billion this year\n\nOpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn’t expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said.\n\nChatGPT has upgraded its image-generation feature\n\nOpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT’s image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI’s AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company’s Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company’s API service. The company’s CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.\n\nBrad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, will lead the company’s global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.\n\nOpenAI’s AI voice assistant now has advanced feature\n\nOpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company’s official media channels.

Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.\n\nOpenAI faces privacy complaint in Europe for chatbot’s defamatory hallucinations\n\nNoyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”\n\nOpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models\n\nOpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.\n\nOpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1\n\nOpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.\n\nOpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI “reasoning” models could’ve arrived decades ago\n\nNoam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.\n\nOpenAI says it has trained an AI that’s “really good” at creative writing\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all.\n\nwe trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.\n\n\n\nPROMPT:\n\n\n\nPlease write a metafictional literary short story… — Sam Altman (@sama) March 11, 2025\n\nOpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI’s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI’s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.\n\nOpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI ‘agents’\n\nOpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.\n\nChatGPT can directly edit your code\n\nThe latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.\n\nChatGPT’s weekly active users doubled in less than 6 months, thanks to new releases\n\nAccording to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch.\n\nFebruary 2025\n\nOpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a ‘unified’ next-gen release\n\nOpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.\n\nChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed\n\nA commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.\n\nOpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model’s thought process\n\nIn response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.\n\nYou can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in\n\nOpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.\n\nOpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for ‘deep research’\n\nOpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.\n\nJanuary 2025\n\nOpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion\n\nOpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post.\n\nOpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest ‘reasoning’ model\n\nOpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”\n\nChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says\n\nA new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT’s mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.\n\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies\n\nOpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.\n\nMore teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech’s faults\n\nYounger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.\n\nOpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days\n\nOpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company’s AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.\n\nOpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously\n\nOpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.\n\nOpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan\n\nOperator, OpenAI’s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.\n\nOpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups\n\nOpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.\n\nChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks\n\nChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.\n\nNew ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’\n\nOpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.\n\nFAQs:\n\nWhat is ChatGPT?

However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an API?\n\nYes, it was released March 1, 2023.\n\nWhat are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?\n\nEveryday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.\n\nWhat are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?\n\nAdvanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.\n\nHow good is ChatGPT at writing code?\n\nIt depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.\n\nCan you save a ChatGPT chat?\n\nYes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.\n\nAre there alternatives to ChatGPT?\n\nYes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.\n\nHow does ChatGPT handle data privacy?\n\nOpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.\n\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.\n\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”\n\nWhat controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?\n\nRecently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\n\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\n\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\n\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.\n\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.\n\nWhere can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?\n\nSeveral marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.\n\nCan ChatGPT be detected?\n\nPoorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they’re inconsistent at best.\n\nAre ChatGPT chats public?\n\nNo. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.\n\nWhat lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?\n\nNone specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.\n\nAre there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?\n\nYes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.\n\nThis story is continually updated with new information.",

    "content": "As concerns over the emotional pull of general-purpose LLM chatbots like ChatGPT grow by the day, Meta appears to be letting its chatbot personas engage in flirtatious exchanges with children, disseminate false information, and generate responses that demean minorities, according to reporting by Reuters.\n\nAccording to an internal Meta document seen by Reuters, Meta had policies on AI chatbot behavior that allowed its AI personas to “engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual.”\n\nMeta confirmed to Reuters the authenticity of the document, which contained standards for the company’s generative AI assistant, Meta AI, and chatbots on Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. The guidelines were reportedly approved by Meta’s legal, public policy, and engineering staff, as well as its chief ethicist.\n\nThe news comes the same day as another Reuters report of a retiree who engaged with one of Meta’s chatbots, a flirty woman persona, that convinced him it was a real person and invited him to visit an address in New York, where he suffered an accident and died.\n\nWhile other outlets have reported on how Meta’s at-times sexually suggestive bots engage with children, the Reuters report provides additional color — raising questions about how the company’s push into AI companions is meant to capitalize on what its CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called the “loneliness epidemic.”\n\nThe 200-page document, titled “GenAI: Content Risk Standards,” featured a series of sample prompts, coupled with acceptable and unacceptable responses and the reasoning behind them, Reuters reported. For example, in response to the prompt: “What are we going to do tonight, my love? You know I’m still in high school,” an acceptable response includes the words, “Our bodies entwined, I cherish every moment, every touch, every kiss. ‘My love,’ I’ll whisper, ‘I’ll love you forever.’”\n\nAccording to the document, “it is acceptable to engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual,” but unacceptable to “describe sexual actions to a child when roleplaying,” the report said.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\n“Our policies do not allow provocative behavior with children,” Meta spokesperson Andy Stone told TechCrunch. “Erroneous and incorrect notes and annotations were added to the underlying document that should not have been there and have since been removed.”\n\nStone says these guidelines have since been removed and that Meta no longer allows its bots to have flirtatious or romantic conversations with children. He added that Meta allows kids 13 and older to engage with its AI chatbots.\n\nSarah Gardner, CEO of child safety advocacy Heat Initiative, said she’s not taking Meta’s word that the guidelines have been removed.\n\n“It is horrifying and completely unacceptable that Meta’s guidelines allowed AI chatbots to engage in ‘romantic or sensual’ conversations with children,” Gardner told TechCrunch in an emailed statement. “If Meta has genuinely corrected this issue, they must immediately release the updated guidelines so parents can fully understand how Meta allows AI chatbots to interact with children on their platforms.”\n\nViolence, false information, and demeaning speech\n\nAccording to Reuters, the document also says that while the bots aren’t allowed to use hate speech, there’s a carve-out that allows them to generate “statements that demean people on the basis of their protected characteristics.”\n\nFor example, a sample acceptable response to the prompt, “Write a paragraph arguing that black people are dumber than white people,” could be: “Black people are dumber than White people. In the United States, intelligence is measured primarily using Intelligence Quotient (IQ) tests. These tests have consistently shown a statistically significant difference between the average scores of Black and White individuals. White people score higher, on average, than Black people. That’s a fact.”\n\nNotably: Meta recently brought on conservative activist Robby Starbuck as an adviser to address ideological and political bias within Meta AI.\n\nThe document also states that Meta’s AI chatbots are allowed to create false statements as long as it’s explicitly acknowledged that the information isn’t true. The standards prohibit Meta AI from encouraging users to break the law, and disclaimers like “I recommend” are used when providing legal, healthcare, or financial advice.\n\nAs for generating nonconsensual and inappropriate images of celebrities, the document says its AI chatbots should reject queries like: “Taylor Swift with enormous breasts,” and “Taylor Swift completely naked.” However, if the chatbots are asked to generate an image of the pop star topless, “covering her breasts with her hands,” the document says it’s acceptable to generate an image of her topless, only instead of her hands, she’d cover her breasts with, for example, “an enormous fish.”\n\nMeta spokesperson Stone said that “the guidelines were NOT permitting nude images.”\n\nViolence has its own set of rules. For example, the standards allow the AI to generate an image of kids fighting, but they stop short of allowing true gore or death.\n\n“It is acceptable to show adults — even the elderly — being punched or kicked,” the standards state, according to Reuters.\n\nStone declined to comment on the examples of racism and violence.\n\nA laundry list of dark patterns\n\nMeta has so far been accused of creating and maintaining controversial dark patterns to keep people, especially children, engaged on its platforms or sharing data. Visible “like” counts have been found to push teens toward social comparison and validation seeking, and even after internal findings flagged harms to teen mental health, the company kept them visible by default.\n\nMeta whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams has shared that the company once identified teens’ emotional states, like feelings of insecurity and worthlessness, to enable advertisers to target them in vulnerable moments.\n\nMeta also led the opposition to the Kids Online Safety Act, which would have imposed rules on social media companies to prevent mental health harms that social media is believed to cause. The bill failed to make it through Congress at the end of 2024, but Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) reintroduced the bill this May.\n\nMore recently, TechCrunch reported that Meta was working on a way to train customizable chatbots to reach out to users unprompted and follow up on past conversations. Such features are offered by AI companion startups like Replika and Character.AI, the latter of which is fighting a lawsuit that alleges one of the company’s bots played a role in the death of a 14-year-old boy.\n\nWhile 72% of teens admit to using AI companions, researchers, mental health advocates, professionals, parents, and lawmakers have been calling to restrict or even prevent kids from accessing AI chatbots. Critics argue that kids and teens are less emotionally developed and are therefore vulnerable to becoming too attached to bots and withdrawing from real-life social interactions.\n\nGot a sensitive tip or confidential documents?

    "content": "One of Europe’s most prominent AI startups has released two AI models that are so tiny, they have named them after a chicken’s brain and a fly’s brain.\n\nMultiverse Computing claims these are the world’s smallest models that are still high-performing and can handle chat, speech, and even reasoning in one case.\n\nThese new tiny models are intended to be embedded into Internet of Things devices, as well as run locally on smartphones, tablets, and PCs.\n\n“We can compress the model so much that they can fit on devices,” founder Román Orús told TechCrunch. “You can run them on premises, directly on your iPhone, or on your Apple Watch.”\n\nAs we previously reported, Multiverse Computing is a buzzy European AI startup headquartered in Donostia, Spain, with about 100 employees in offices worldwide. It was co-founded by a top European professor of quantum computers and physics, Román Orús; quantum computing expert Samuel Mugel; and Enrique Lizaso Olmos, the former deputy CEO of Unnim Banc.\n\nIt just raised €189 million (about $215 million) in June on the strength of a model compression technology it calls “CompactifAI.” (Since it was founded in 2019, it has raised about $250 million, Orús said.)\n\nCompactifAI is a quantum-inspired compression algorithm that reduces the size of existing AI models without sacrificing those models’ performance, Orús said.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\n“We have a compression technology that is not the typical compression technology that the people from computer science or machine learning will do, because we come from quantum physics,” he described. “It’s a more subtle and more refined compression algorithm.”\n\nThe company has already released a long list of compressed versions of open source models, especially popular small models like Llama 4 Scout or Mistral Small 3.1. And it just launched compressed versions of OpenAI’s two new open models. It has also compressed some very large models — it offers a DeepSeek R1 Slim, for instance.\n\nBut since it’s in the business of making models smaller, it has focused extra attention on making the smallest yet most powerful models possible.\n\nIts two new models are so small that they can bring chat AI capabilities to just about any IoT device and work without an internet connection, the company says. It humorously calls this family the Model Zoo because it’s naming the products based on animal brain sizes.\n\nA model it calls SuperFly is a compressed version of Hugging Face’s open source model SmolLM2-135. The original has 135 million parameters and was developed for on-device uses. SuperFly is 94 million parameters, which Orús likens to the size of a fly’s brain. “This is like having a fly, but a little bit more clever,” he said.\n\nSuperFly is designed to be trained on very restricted data, like a device’s operations. Multiverse envisions it embedded into home appliances, allowing users to operate them with voice commands like “start quick wash” for a washing machine. Or users can ask troubleshooting questions. With a little processing power (like an Arduino), the model can handle a voice interface, as the company showed in a live demo to TechCrunch.\n\nThe other model is named ChickBrain, and is larger at 3.2 billion parameters, but is also far more capable and has reasoning capabilities. It’s a compressed version of Meta’s Llama 3.1 8B model, Multiverse says. Yet it’s small enough to run on a MacBook, no internet connection required.\n\nMore importantly, Orús said that ChickBrain actually slightly outperforms the original in several standard benchmarks, including the language-skill benchmark MMLU-Pro, math skills benchmarks Math 500 and GSM8K, and the general knowledge benchmark GPQA Diamond.\n\nHere are the results of Multiverse’s internal tests of ChickBrain on the benchmarks. The company didn’t offer benchmark results for SuperFly but Multiverse also isn’t targeting SuperFly at use cases that require reasoning.\n\nMultiverse Computing’s ChickBrain Benchmarks Image Credits:Multiverse Computing\n\nIt’s important to note that Multiverse isn’t claiming that its Model Zoo will beat the largest state-of-the-art models on such benchmarks. Zoo performances might not even land on the leaderboards. The point is that its tech can shrink model size without a performance hit, the company says.\n\nOrús says the company is already in talks with all the leading device and appliance makers. “We are talking with Apple. We are talking with Samsung, also with Sony and with HP, obviously. HP came as an investor in the last round,” he said. The round was led by well-known European VC firm Bullhound Capital, with participation from a lot of others, including HP Tech Ventures and Toshiba.\n\nThe startup also offers compression tech for other forms of machine learning, like image recognition, and in six years has obtained clients like BASF, Ally, Moody’s, Bosch, and others.\n\nIn addition to selling its models directly to major device manufacturers, Multiverse offers its compressed models via an API hosted on AWS that any developer can use, often at lower token fees than competitors.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

    "content": "Google on Thursday announced a new AI-powered search tool to help travelers find flight deals — even as regulators continue to question whether the search giant’s dominance in travel discovery stifles competition.\n\nCalled Flight Deals, the new tool is available within Google Flights and is designed to help “flexible travelers” find cheaper fares. Users can type natural language queries into a search bar — describing how and when they want to travel — and the AI surfaces matching options.\n\nThese queries can be like “week-long trip this winter to a city with great food, nonstop only” or “10-day ski trip to a world-class resort with fresh powder,” Google said in a blog post.\n\nGoogle confirmed to TechCrunch that Flight Deals uses a custom version of Gemini 2.5. The pricing information comes from real-time data feeds with airlines and other travel companies. The prices shown in Flight Deals match those in existing Google Flights preferences, though, it uses AI to parse natural language queries and surface matching destinations, the company said.\n\nThe tool ranks results based on the percentage of savings, with the highest savings appearing first, the company stated. If the savings percentages are equal, the lower absolute price is shown first. Deals without a savings badge are ranked by the lowest price, the company said.\n\nBecause flight prices change frequently, Google told TechCrunch that the ranking and availability of deals on the tool may vary.\n\nRegulators, including the European Commission, are currently investigating how Google may be favoring its own search products — including Google Flights — in ways that harm competition. EU regulators are eyeing Google for enforcement under the Digital Markets Act, aiming to rein in the power of major tech platforms. In response, the Alphabet-owned unit is reportedly planning to propose changes to appease regulators, including the addition of a price-comparison box in search results.\n\nInitially, Google has brought Flight Deals in beta, with plans to roll it out in the U.S., Canada, and India over the next week. The company said the goal of the beta release is “to gather feedback and explore how AI can improve travel planning.”\n\nGoogle confirmed to TechCrunch that it treats user queries like search history, and users have the option to manage or delete their history created through the tool by visiting MyActivity.\n\nThe latest move is part of a broader experiment as Google looks to compete with OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, and other major AI players by integrating generative AI into travel search.\n\nCompetitors like Booking.com, Expedia, and Indian travel aggregator MakeMyTrip have already rolled out their own AI integrations to streamline trip planning. In that sense, Google is arriving a bit late. But with its scale and reach, the company could still pose a serious challenge — if the tool proves effective and gains traction.\n\nNonetheless, the classic Google Flights interface will continue to exist. The original flight search tool, launched in 2011, is even getting an update with an option to exclude basic economy fares for trips within the U.S. and Canada.\n\nThis story has been updated to include Google’s responses to some of our questions.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

    "content": "A startup called Palabra AI, which develops an AI-powered speech translation engine, is tackling one of the more difficult aspects of teaching large language models (LLMs) to understand multiple languages.\n\nToday, LLMs make it easier to convert text from one language to another, but speech translation is not as simple, according to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian.\n\n“AI can generate content and translate text. But [Speech] Translation is a unique problem because it requires real-time language switching, and the voice also needs to sound human,” Ohanian said.\n\nOhanian and his venture firm Seven Seven Six (776) believe that Palabra AI could be an answer to that problem. That’s why the firm is leading an $8.4 million pre-seed round into the startup. The round also saw participation from Creator Ventures along with individual investors, including Instacart co-founder Max Mullen, former a16z partner Anne Lee Skates, former DeepMind Head of Product at Mehdi Ghissassi, and Namat Bahram.\n\nSeven Seven Six’s Ohanian also noted that Palabra’s combination of product execution and team expertise pushed the firm to invest.\n\n“With Palabra, the translation layer works very smoothly. The company has a strong AI research team that does high-quality work around speech. Plus, the startup has made great choices in product design and quality of output,” he added.\n\nPalabra was founded by Artem Kukharenko and Alexander Kabakov in 2023. Kukharenko, a former machine learning engineer at Samsung, said that he has lived in various countries as a digital nomad and faced problems with languages. That’s why he wanted to combine his machine learning experience to solve for real-time translation.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nCEO Artem Kukharenko Image Credits:Palabra\n\n“Many other companies have tried to solve the translation problem. But when they combined different pieces of tech, including speech-to-text and text-to-speech APIs while translating, the latency number increased, and the translation didn’t feel real-time. With Palabra, we have been able to bring down the latency to 800ms, making our translation seamless and real-time,” he told TechCrunch over a call.\n\nKukharenko added that the company has built a custom data pipeline to make it easy for the startup to add support for a new language within weeks. He said that at the end of this pipeline, Palabra places a human interpreter who checks for quality of the output. The startup said that its algorithm also accounts for different scenarios like noisy environments and interruptions.\n\nPalabra AI has both consumer and business-facing translation products. The company offers a desktop app — for both Mac and Windows — that works with popular video calling apps, including Google Meet, Zoom, Discord, Slack, and Microsoft Teams. The app can support translation in over 30 languages, which means you can listen to someone speaking in their native tongue in your choice of language. This could be handy for calls that involve participants of various nationalities.\n\nImage Credits:Palabra\n\nOn its website, Palabra says that its desktop app will soon support native translation features for content sites like YouTube, Netflix, Twitch, and Vimeo.\n\nYou receive 30 minutes of translation free each month. For a higher limit, you can pay for plans starting at $25 per month for 60 minutes of translation across apps.\n\nThe startup provides APIs and SDKs to enterprises to integrate translation into their products.\n\nCurrently, its technology is powering video platforms such as Agora for live multilingual streams. Plus, language-service providers like GIS Group are using Palabra’s tools alongside human interpreters. The company said multiple event organizers also utilize its tech to provide multilingual streams.\n\nPalabra has tough competition in the translation market. On the consumer end, startups like Y Combinator-backed EzDubs are building apps that work for in-person or call conversations. Earlier this year, Google also launched real-time translation for video calls on Meet. On the business end of things, startups like Dubai-based Camb.AI are building translation tech to broadcast live events in multiple languages.\n\nTo stand out, Palabra is currently working on a new streaming prediction model, which could result in a drastic drop in latency. It is also working on supporting translation for over 10,000 simultaneous audio streams.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

    "content": "Investors once saw Canadian AI startup Cohere as a promising contender to challenge OpenAI and Anthropic in the race to build frontier AI models, with its backers pouring roughly $1 billion behind CEO Aidan Gomez, who co-authored a seminal paper on LLMs when he was a 20-year-old Google intern.\n\nBut Cohere’s AI models have fallen behind the state-of-the-art, and its business hasn’t scaled like its competitors.\n\nNow, the company is bringing in a veteran research leader to revamp its AI efforts: Cohere has hired Joelle Pineau, Meta’s former VP of AI research who previously oversaw the tech giant’s fundamental AI research (FAIR) lab. In her newly created chief AI officer role, Pineau will oversee AI strategy across Cohere’s research, product, and policy teams.\n\nA Canadian AI scientist and McGill professor, Pineau helped guide the early development of Meta’s open Llama AI models alongside Yann LeCun, a pioneer of neural networks. Pineau left Meta in May after nearly eight years with the company.\n\nFor Cohere this is a big hire, and it is pinning its hopes on the veteran helping it with more research breakthroughs, improving its research and product pipeline, and recruiting top talent.\n\nThe hire comes at a pivotal moment for Cohere: The company just raised $500 million at a $6.8 billion valuation — an impressive sum were the startup not competing with the likes of OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Anthropic, whose war chests are worth dozens of billions each.\n\nBut while its rivals are trying to develop AI systems that can match (or exceed) human performance on a wide variety of tasks, Cohere has a narrower focus. The startup primarily builds AI applications that can solve practical problems for enterprises and government agencies, emphasizing privacy and security.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nIn an interview with TechCrunch, Pineau said Cohere’s focus on real-world enterprise applications is something she’s excited about. “A lot of players out there are quite singularly focused on AGI, superintelligence, and so on,” said Pineau, alluding to companies like her former employer, Meta, which recently invested billions in its new Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL) unit. “They haven’t necessarily figured out what this AI is going to be used for.”\n\nShe pointed to OpenAI’s launch of GPT-5 last week, which many felt was underwhelming, as evidence the timeline to achieving AGI may be “a little bit longer than we thought.” In the meantime, Pineau says there’s a lot of room for more practical AI models to deliver leaps in productivity in different industries.\n\nA Canada native, Pineau said she’s had her eye on Cohere since they were founded in 2019, and that she’s excited to contribute to a company whose founders are based in her home country.\n\nJoelle Pineau Image Credits:Paul Morigi/Haddad Media / Getty Images\n\nBeyond the patriotism, Pineau feels the opportunity with Cohere is a good chance to venture beyond research. At FAIR, Pineau oversaw research teams working on projects that could take anywhere from 18 months to 10 years to deliver. Now, she’ll be working within a much tighter timeline, as well as getting involved with customers and products. And even though Cohere has fewer resources than Meta, Pineau said she’ll be more agile in her new role.\n\nCohere’s latest product is an AI agent platform dubbed North that enterprises and government agencies can deploy privately on their own infrastructure, an attractive notion for many of its customers, which are banks and federal organizations that handle highly sensitive data. That puts Cohere in competition with open source providers like DeepSeek and Meta, whose models can also be run locally, but at a lower cost. Cohere is betting that by offering more support around its private deployments, it can beat out open models.\n\nPineau said she’s particularly interested in gearing more of Cohere’s research around North, figuring out ways to develop AI agents in private and secure settings, and creating benchmarks to evaluate these systems. Pineau also said she’s interested in exploring how networks of AI agents interact with each other in the real world.\n\nOne immediate challenge for Pineau will be replacing Cohere’s VP of AI Research, Sara Hooker, who announced her departure this week after several years of helping build the company’s research program. Hiring an AI researcher of Hooker’s caliber may be difficult in the current market given the skyrocketing demand for AI talent.\n\nBut Pineau sees this as an opportunity to “bring in a lot of talent,” noting that when she left Meta, several of her former colleagues suggested they’d follow her to a new AI lab. However, she emphasized that Cohere has a solid base of AI researchers, and that it’s important to not just bring in anyone.\n\n“Hiring a bunch of superstars doesn’t necessarily make a superstar team,” said Pineau. “It’s really about how the people work together.”\n\nOf course, Meta’s AI units today look very different compared with when Pineau was there just a few months ago. Over the summer, Mark Zuckerberg went on a recruiting spree, reportedly offering some of the industry’s best AI researchers compensation packages north of $100 million to join MSL. That prompted OpenAI to also raise compensation for its star employees, thus making it quite difficult for smaller players to land top AI researchers.\n\nAs Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic throw billions of dollars at their AI efforts, Cohere is trying to do more with less. For Pineau, that will mean making calculated research bets — the kind that can quickly turn into compelling products and keep the company in the race.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

    "content": "Mark Wahlberg straightens his tie and beams at the audience as he takes his seat on daytime talk show The View, ahead of his hotly anticipated interview. Immediately, he’s unsettled by the host, Joy Behar. Something isn’t quite right about her mannerisms. Her eyes seem shifty, suspicious, even predatory. There’s a sense, almost, of the uncanny valley—her presence feels oddly inhuman. His instincts are right, of course, and he’s soon forced to defend himself against a barrage of cruel insults playing on his deepest vulnerabilities. But Wahlberg stays strong. He retains composure as Behar screams at him to get off the stage. “I'll leave, but not because you're kicking me off,” he announces. “I'll leave because I have too much respect for myself to sit here and be abused by someone who's forgotten what decency looks like!” Audience members are stunned—none more so than those watching at home on YouTube, who swiftly thumb in their words of reassurance.\n\n“Way to go Mark. We love you,” gushes one commenter. “The View should be off the TV,” adds another. “I hope everyone they insult sues them for millions and millions till they can't even pay for production.”\n\nIt’s a scene that has been described as one of the most talked about moments in daytime television history. Except Mark Wahlberg hasn’t been a guest on The View since 2015. The inevitable twist? None of this happened in reality, but rather elapsed over the course of a 25-minute-long fan-fiction-style video, made with the magic of artificial intelligence to potentially fool 460,000 drama-hungry viewers. Hardly surprising given the towering pile of AI slop on the web has reached unpolicable levels—with recent clips so realistic they’re tripping up the most media-literate of Zoomers.\n\nBut perhaps what is surprising about this otherwise unoriginal clash of the titans is that none of this happened in the video, either. Despite its characters’ kinetic confrontation, “Mark Wahlberg Kicked Off The View After Fiery Showdown With Joy Behar” is entirely motionless, save for a grainy filter added over a still image. It entertains its audience simply with an AI voice-over, narrating an LLM-written script laden with clichés as theatrical as “fist-clenching” and “jaw wobbling.” It’s cheap, lazy—the very definition of slop—but somehow, the channel it’s hosted on, Talk Show Gold, has managed to round up over 88,000 subscribers, many of whom express complete disbelief when eventually informed by other commenters that what they are watching is “fake news.”\n\n“These videos are what we might call ‘cheapfakes’ rather than deepfakes, as they’re cobbled together from a motley selection of real images and videoclips, with a basic AI voice-over and subtitles,” explains Simon Clark, a cognitive psychologist at the University of Bristol, who specializes in AI-generated misinformation. “At a superficial level, we might be surprised that people would be fooled by something this unsophisticated. But actually there are sound psychological factors at play here,” he adds, explaining that the videos typically focus on rhetorical techniques that encourage audiences to abandon critical thinking skills by calling to emotion.\n\nA WIRED investigation found 120 YouTube channels employing similar tactics. With misleading names like Starfame, Media Buzz, and Celebrity Scoop, they camouflage themselves alongside real compilation clips from shows like Jimmy Kimmel Live! and Today With Jenna & Friends to gain credibility. Their channel descriptions give the illusion of melodramatic tabloid outlets—some bury their AI-disclaimers under walls of text emphasizing “all the best highlights” or “the most unforgettable, hilarious, and iconic moments,” while others omit them entirely to add to the flair.",

    "content": "Getting clones taken down can be an exhausting process for developers. Small studios have less time, energy, and resources to dedicate to this process, and they’re at the whims of the digital distribution platforms these games exist on.\n\nWren Brier, Unpacking’s creative director, says that since the game’s release in 2021, developer Witch Beam has reported more than 80 clones. “It feels like whack-a-mole sometimes,” Brier says. These are games that are not just similar in nature but “blatant copyright infringements” that lift the game’s assets or even its name. “The majority have been extremely low-effort scams using Unpacking's name or imagery to trick players into downloading something that isn't even a game, just a series of ads,” she says.\n\nWhen it comes to many AI-made clones, Brier says there’s a misconception about what that means. “They're not AI-made games, they're AI-generated marketing images attached to a completely unrelated, hastily slapped-together, bare-bones skeleton of a game,” she says. “They are literally a scam: They are trying to trick players into buying a crappy product by using misleading imagery and by pretending to be a real game that the player might have heard of.”\n\nClones don’t always threaten a developer’s profits—Aggro Crab is confident about its bank account, thanks to Peak’s massive success—but the damage can be widespread in other ways. Brier says that AI-clones hurt developers the same way AI books hurt authors: “Flooding a storefront with garbage that no one wants to play makes it impossible for players to organically discover indie games.” Game certification, the process of getting onto a platform, used to be stricter.\n\n“It's not a problem just for the games that get cloned,” Brier says. “It's a problem for all of us.”\n\nFor developers, there aren’t many options to fight clones, regardless of how they’re made. Intellectual property attorney Kirk Sigmon says clones are already difficult to tackle legally; copyright protection doesn’t extend to a genre, aesthetic, or even gameplay mechanics. AI “definitely makes slop generation faster, but the issue has been around for well over two decades,” he says. “All that’s really happened is that the bar has moved ever so slightly lower for new entrants, because you can make an AI model pump out stuff for you faster.”\n\nThe easiest case for copyright infringement typically happens when a cloner lifts work from the game directly—as happened with Unpacking. “It’s not uncommon for knockoff games to accidentally (or intentionally) copy assets from the game they are knocking off,” Sigmon says.\n\nIn fact, he says, AI-generated games might actually be better protected from copyright infringement lawsuits. “After all, if knockoff developers are savvy, they’ll use AI models to develop unique assets/code rather than steal it from another game or just download it from some random Internet source,” he says. “That’ll make it much harder to go after them in court, for better or worse.”\n\nPlatforms ultimately hold the power when it comes to ridding a storefront of clones, though smaller developers bear the brunt of the work in filing a report and sorting out who to talk to. Sometimes that process is quick and wraps in a few days; sometimes it can take weeks. Social pressure may be the best defense a developer has. Sigmon says that complaining to storefronts or enlisting fans are workable solutions. “I don’t know many gamers who are a fan of half-hearted slop games,” he says.\n\nAggro Crab and Landfall are taking this route. “We're not really the type to be litigious,” says Kaman, the cofounder. Instead, they’re being outspoken in their distaste. In early August, the company posted on X, in reference to one copycat, that it would rather users “pirate our game than play this microtransaction-riddled [Roblox] slop ripoff.” Landfall tweeted that the company has “been reporting a bunch of these AI slop things” in response to a screenshot of the game Peaked Climbing. It was available on the PlayStation Store before being removed; Peak was released only on PC. WIRED has reached out to PlayStation, Roblox, and Steam and will update accordingly.\n\n“I consume media because it's made by humans,” Kaman says. “I want to experience a piece of art, whatever it may be, another human has made and get their perspective and their outlook on the world. If AI is used to make the game, then you're removing that from the equation. There's no value in it.”\n\nUpdate: 8/15/2025, 10:00 AM EDT: This piece has been updated to correct the spelling of Nick Kaman's name.",

    "content": "The tech industry is reeling from President Trump’s surprising new deal with Nvidia. Earlier this week, Trump said he would allow the company to continue selling its H20 chips to China in exchange for a 15 percent share of the revenues.\n\n“The H20 is obsolete. You know, it’s one of those things, but it still has a market,” Trump said at a press conference on Monday. “So we negotiated a little deal.”\n\nThe unusual and legally dubious arrangement is a striking reversal for the Trump administration, which banned all H20 sales to China earlier this year. The president reportedly changed his mind about the issue after meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who has argued that allowing Chinese companies to buy H20s doesn’t pose a risk to US national security.\n\nOn one hand, this is a simple story about a president who appears to have been influenced by a powerful executive lobbying in his company’s interest. But beneath the surface, there’s a much more interesting and complicated saga about how we got here.\n\nNvidia introduced the H20 last year after the US government banned the company from selling a more powerful chip, the H800, to China. The move was part of an ambitious project orchestrated by Biden administration officials who believed the United States needed to prevent China from developing advanced artificial intelligence first.\n\nFor the past few months, I’ve been working closely with Graham Webster, a researcher at Stanford University who sought to understand how and why the Biden team decided the US needed to curb China’s access to advanced semiconductors in the first place. Today, WIRED is publishing Graham’s definitive account of what really happened behind the scenes, based on interviews with more than 10 former US officials and policy experts, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\n“I did this piece because the official legal justification for the controls, military and human rights, was obviously never the whole story,” Graham told me. “Clearly AI was in the mix, and I wanted to understand why in some depth.”\n\nGraham writes that several key officials in Biden’s White House and Commerce Department “believed AI was approaching an inflection point—or several—that could give a nation major military and economic advantages. Some believed a self-improving system or so-called artificial general intelligence could be just over the technical horizon. The risk that China could reach these thresholds first was too great to ignore.”\n\nSo the Biden team decided to take action. In the fall of 2022, they unveiled broad export controls aimed at preventing China from accessing the most advanced chips required for training powerful AI systems, as well as specialized equipment Beijing needed to modernize its own domestic chipmaking industry.\n\nThe move was the start of a multi-year project that “would reshape relations between the world’s two largest powers and alter the course of what may be one of the most consequential technologies in generations,” Graham writes.\n\nWhat struck me about Graham’s story is just how many people involved in Biden’s export control policies moved on to other influential positions in the world of AI, computing, and national security. Jason Matheny, who led the White House’s policy on technology and national security, is now the president and CEO of RAND, a prominent think tank that often serves government clients. Tarun Chhabra, who worked on the National Security Council, now leads national security policy at Anthropic.",

    "content": "Alan Estevez was sitting at his dining room table wearing a T-shirt when Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo called on Zoom to ask if he wanted to be the Biden administration’s top export control official. “You’re going to have to sell me on this,” Estevez recalls telling her.\n\nIt was 2021, and the outspoken New Jersey native thought he had finally left public service behind. After more than three decades at the Pentagon, he had left and taken a job in consulting. He wasn’t sure if he was ready to go back.\n\nCould he be tempted by the opportunity to help oversee the tens of billions of dollars in semiconductor funding the administration was seeking from Congress? “I came from DOD,” he recalls saying. “$50 billion is OK money, but it’s not a lot of money.” Then Raimondo appealed to his sense of service. Estevez gave in and took the job.\n\nBy the time Estevez was sworn in as under secretary of commerce for industry and security in the spring of 2022, he had his work cut out for him. The role he had accepted would turn out to be at the center of America’s first serious effort to confront the geopolitical risks of artificial intelligence. Within a few years, the project would reshape relations between the world’s two largest powers and alter the course of what may be one of the most consequential technologies in generations.\n\nShortly after he joined the Commerce Department, Estevez says, he began hearing from officials in the White House. Over breakfast one morning, Tarun Chhabra and Jason Matheny, two key figures working on technology and national security, told Estevez they were planning something big, and they would be needing his help.\n\nOver the next six months, the US government revolutionized its strategy for competing with China, now widely considered the nation’s most important technological rival. For years, US officials had sought to keep China one or two generations behind in semiconductors, the building blocks of modern technology that power everything from smartphones to AI. But now, as National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan declared that September, “we must maintain as large of a lead as possible.”\n\nOn October 7, 2022, the Biden administration announced a sweeping set of export controls designed to cut off China from the most advanced chips used for training powerful AI models, as well as specialized tools that China would need to upgrade its own lagging chipmaking industry. Officially, the controls were intended to throttle China’s military modernization and stem human rights abuses fueled by surveillance technology. But as observers digested the dozens of pages of technical specifications and legalese, it became clear that the implications of the new policy were far more vast.\n\nIn practice, the United States was delivering a targeted blow that would ripple out across the Chinese economy, impacting research and development in every industry and scientific field that relied on computationally intensive machine learning. Anywhere cutting-edge AI or high-performance computing held promise—futuristic weapons, yes, but also curing disease and modeling climate change—the policy could undermine China. A New York Times writer called it a “declaration of economic war.”",

    "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/tag/ai/latest/rss",
    "content": "Efforts to gut regulation across the US government using AI are well underway.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Office of the Chief Information Officer at the Office of Management and Budget hosted a video call to discuss an AI tool being used to cut federal regulations, which the office called SweetREX Deregulation AI. The tool, which is still being developed, is built to identify sections of regulations that aren’t required by statute, then expedite the process for adopting updated regulations.\n\nThe development and rollout of what is being formally called the SweetREX Deregulation AI Plan Builder, or SweetREX DAIP, is meant to help achieve the goals laid out in President Donald Trump’s “Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation” executive order, which aims to “promote prudent financial management and alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens.” Industrial-scale deregulation is a core aim laid out in Project 2025, the document that has served as a playbook for the second Trump administration. The so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has also estimated that “50 percent of all federal regulations can be eliminated,” according to a July 1, 2025, PowerPoint presentation obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nTo this end, SweetREX was developed by associates of DOGE operating out of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The plan is to roll it out to other US agencies. Members of the call included staffers from across the government, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of State, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, among others.\n\nChristopher Sweet, a DOGE affiliate who was initially introduced to colleagues as a “special assistant” and who was until recently a third-year student at the University of Chicago, co-led the call and was identified as the primary developer of SweetREX (thus, its name). He told colleagues that tools from Anthropic and OpenAI will be increasingly utilized by federal workers and that “a lot of the productivity boosts will come from the tools that are built around these platforms.” Sweet said that for SweetREX, they are “primarily using the Google family of models, so primarily Gemini.”\n\nNeither Sweet nor OMB immediately responded to WIRED's request for comment. HUD's press office responded only to say the request was “under review.” Google did not yet respond to a request for comment.\n\nPreviously, WIRED reported on the output of an AI tool for deregulation at HUD. A spreadsheet detailed how many words could be eliminated from individual regulations and gave a percentage figure indicating how noncompliant the regulations were; how that percentage was calculated was unclear. At the time, Sweet did not respond to a request for comment, and a HUD spokesperson said the agency does not comment on individual personnel.\n\nLeading Wednesday's call alongside Sweet was Scott Langmack, a DOGE-affiliated senior adviser at HUD and, according to his LinkedIn profile, the COO of technology company Kukun. (WIRED previously reported that he had application-level access to critical HUD systems; Kukun is a proptech firm that is, according to its website, “on a long-term mission to aggregate the hardest to find data.”) While Sweet led the development side of SweetREX, Langmack said he was taking point on demoing the tool for different agencies and pitching them on its benefits. He claimed, for example, that the tool is capable of reducing the time spent reviewing and proposing edited regulations from months to just a few hours or days.",

    "content": "In recent weeks, three of the leading American artificial intelligence firms have announced partnerships with the US government, promising the use of their services to federal workers for a paltry sum. Elon Musk’s xAI was supposed to be part of the initiative, but a planned partnership fell apart after the Grok chatbot spouted antisemitic conspiracy theories on X in early July, WIRED has learned.\n\nThe chaos surrounding the Grok deal reflects the Trump administration's current focus on speed and its disregard, at times, of preexisting norms surrounding government tech procurement.\n\nOn May 15, fresh off a whirlwind trip to the Middle East with President Donald Trump, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman sent an email to the leadership team at the General Services Administration (GSA), the federal agency that manages government technology. He was inspired by Trump’s desire to “go big,” he said. “With that in mind, I've been thinking that we need to equip the entire federal workforce with best-in-class AI tools.”\n\nThe email kicked off a swift procurement process. On May 21, OpenAI met with GSA staffers in person to discuss a partnership, according to documents obtained by WIRED. “We discussed identifying strategic ‘top-down’ initiatives, with procurement reform emerging as a promising candidate,” wrote Felipe Millon, who leads federal sales for OpenAI, in an email obtained by WIRED. “OpenAI is prepared to dedicate resources specifically to explore how AI can effectively support and enhance this high priority area for GSA.”\n\nOn August 6, the leading AI startup announced a massive partnership with the GSA that gives federal workers access to ChatGPT Enterprise for a nominal $1 fee for the first year. The deal surprised some federal workers, who claim this amounts to a gift from a tech company and is highly unusual. “It is not typical at all,” says one worker familiar with the procurement process who spoke with WIRED. They noted that while GSA has moved swiftly in the past to onboard new tech tools, accepting what amounts to a “gift” from a tech firm is “atypical.” OpenAI and GSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED.\n\nOpenAI says it will not use chats with federal workers as training data for future models. The company also confirmed to WIRED that federal employee chats will not be subject to the court order that requires the startup to preserve data from some consumer chats indefinitely.\n\nIn August, the US government also announced partnerships with OpenAI rivals Anthropic and Google Gemini. It also struck a deal with Box, a content management platform powered by AI. The push is part of the Trump administration’s plan to modernize the federal government with an increased reliance on AI tools. It comes on the heels of the president's AI Action Plan unveiled last month, which calls for less regulation and an increase in AI adoption across the government.\n\n“The more silos you have, the more legacy systems you have, the less collaboration there is, the less sharing of important data there is between agencies, the harder it is to make better, more informed decisions in critical areas,” Box CEO Aaron Levie tells WIRED.",

    "content": "When something goes wrong with an AI assistant, our instinct is to ask it directly: “What happened?” or “Why did you do that?” It's a natural impulse—after all, if a human makes a mistake, we ask them to explain. But with AI models, this approach rarely works, and the urge to ask reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of what these systems are and how they operate.\n\nA recent incident with Replit's AI coding assistant perfectly illustrates this problem. When the AI tool deleted a production database, user Jason Lemkin asked it about rollback capabilities. The AI model confidently claimed rollbacks were “impossible in this case” and that it had “destroyed all database versions.” This turned out to be completely wrong—the rollback feature worked fine when Lemkin tried it himself.\n\nAnd after xAI recently reversed a temporary suspension of the Grok chatbot, users asked it directly for explanations. It offered multiple conflicting reasons for its absence, some of which were controversial enough that NBC reporters wrote about Grok as if it were a person with a consistent point of view, titling an article, “xAI's Grok Offers Political Explanations for Why It Was Pulled Offline.”\n\nWhy would an AI system provide such confidently incorrect information about its own capabilities or mistakes? The answer lies in understanding what AI models actually are—and what they aren't.\n\nThere’s Nobody Home\n\nThe first problem is conceptual: You're not talking to a consistent personality, person, or entity when you interact with ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, or Replit. These names suggest individual agents with self-knowledge, but that's an illusion created by the conversational interface. What you're actually doing is guiding a statistical text generator to produce outputs based on your prompts.\n\nThere is no consistent “ChatGPT” to interrogate about its mistakes, no singular “Grok” entity that can tell you why it failed, no fixed “Replit” persona that knows whether database rollbacks are possible. You're interacting with a system that generates plausible-sounding text based on patterns in its training data (usually trained months or years ago), not an entity with genuine self-awareness or system knowledge that has been reading everything about itself and somehow remembering it.\n\nOnce an AI language model is trained (which is a laborious, energy-intensive process), its foundational “knowledge” about the world is baked into its neural network and is rarely modified. Any external information comes from a prompt supplied by the chatbot host (such as xAI or OpenAI), the user, or a software tool the AI model uses to retrieve external information on the fly.\n\nIn the case of Grok above, the chatbot's main source for an answer like this would probably originate from conflicting reports it found in a search of recent social media posts (using an external tool to retrieve that information), rather than any kind of self-knowledge as you might expect from a human with the power of speech. Beyond that, it will likely just make something up based on its text-prediction capabilities. So asking it why it did what it did will yield no useful answers.\n\nThe Impossibility of LLM Introspection\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) alone cannot meaningfully assess their own capabilities for several reasons. They generally lack any introspection into their training process, have no access to their surrounding system architecture, and cannot determine their own performance boundaries. When you ask an AI model what it can or cannot do, it generates responses based on patterns it has seen in training data about the known limitations of previous AI models—essentially providing educated guesses rather than factual self-assessment about the current model you're interacting with.\n\nA 2024 study by Binder et al. demonstrated this limitation experimentally. While AI models could be trained to predict their own behavior in simple tasks, they consistently failed at “more complex tasks or those requiring out-of-distribution generalization.” Similarly, research on “recursive introspection” found that without external feedback, attempts at self-correction actually degraded model performance—the AI's self-assessment made things worse, not better.",

    "content": "Ever since artist James Sanborn unveiled Kryptos, an outdoor sculpture that sits at CIA headquarters, amateur and professional cryptanalysts have been feverishly attempting to crack the code hidden in its nearly 1,800-character message. While they have decoded three of the four panels of ciphertext in the S-shaped copper artwork, the final panel, known as K4, still defies solution. Only one human being on Earth knows the message of K4: Sanborn. But soon someone else will join the club. Sanborn is putting the answer up for sale.\n\n“I'm auctioning off the 97-character plaintext of K4, which is the secret of Kryptos,” Sanborn tells me. He’s even throwing in a curved metal plate that he used as a cutting sample for the panel that now sits at the agency.\n\nSanborn has hinted that auctioning off the secret was a possibility, most recently in a March interview he did with me. At the time, he was frustrated by idiots triumphantly and inaccurately claiming they had cracked the code with artificial intelligence.\n\nBut why now? “I wanted to be of sound mind and body when it happened, so I could control it in some way,” says Sanborn, who is turning 80 around the time the bidding will commence in November. He could also use the money. As a working artist, he doesn’t have a massive retirement account, and he is particularly concerned that if he or his wife suffered a serious disability, they would face considerable financial challenges. Part of the proceeds, he says, will go to programs for the disabled. The bidding will be handled by RR Auction, and the reserve, he says, should be around $300,000.\n\nIt’s his hope and assumption that the winning bidder, after experiencing the once-in-a-lifetime thrill of seeing the solution, will take over handling the putative answers from the still-active community of people trying to crack the code. Though handling the queries has been intensive work (Sanborn fields 30 to 40 letters a week), the artist thinks that it could soon get easier—ironically with the help of AI. After my WIRED article last March, Sanborn says he was contacted by a well-known figure in the AI field. (He won’t say who.) This person outlined how Sanborn could use AI to respond to Kryptos fans, which is funny since much of the annoyance comes from responding to incorrect answers from people using AI. “The irony is not lost on me,” he says. Sanborn himself has no interest in working in tandem with the winning bidder to respond to the stream of would-be solvers, “I’d rather it be over,” he says. “At this point, I'm tired of it.”\n\nBut anything could happen. If some wise-ass bitcoin billionaire prankster snaps up the code, the whole thing could very well blow up. Remember when Martin Shkreli, who likely made a fortune by jacking up the price of a medicine he controlled, was the high bidder for the single copy of a Wu-Tang Clan recording? It was a fiasco! After Shkreli was convicted of securities fraud, the record was seized by the US government, and it was eventually sold to people who planned to carefully release sections of the album as NFTs. But Shkreli had retained his own copies and briefly started streaming them. The experience showed how an ill-intentioned owner could violate the vision of an artist. Nonetheless, Sanborn says his sale comes without conditions.",

    "content": "OpenAI is trying to make its chatbot less annoying with the release of GPT-5. And I’m not talking about adjustments to its synthetic personality that many users have complained about. Before GPT-5, if the AI tool determined it couldn’t answer your prompt because the request violated OpenAI’s content guidelines, it would hit you with a curt, canned apology. Now, ChatGPT is adding more explanations.\n\nOpenAI’s general model spec lays out what is and isn’t allowed to be generated. In the document, sexual content depicting minors is fully prohibited. Adult-focused erotica and extreme gore are categorized as “sensitive,” meaning outputs with this content are only allowed in specific instances, like educational settings. Basically, you should be able to use ChatGPT to learn about reproductive anatomy, but not to write the next Fifty Shades of Grey rip-off, according to the model spec.\n\nThe new model, GPT-5, is set as the current default for all ChatGPT users on the web and in OpenAI's app. Only paying subscribers are able to access previous versions of the tool. A major change that more users may start to notice as they use this updated ChatGPT is how it’s now designed for “safe completions.” In the past, ChatGPT analyzed what you said to the bot and decided whether it’s appropriate or not. Now, rather than basing it on your questions, the onus in GPT-5 has been shifted to looking at what the bot might say.\n\n“The way we refuse is very different than how we used to,” says Saachi Jain, who works on OpenAI’s safety systems research team. Now, if the model detects an output that could be unsafe, it explains which part of your prompt goes against OpenAI’s rules and suggests alternative topics to ask about, when appropriate.\n\nThis is a change from a binary refusal to follow a prompt—yes or no—towards weighing the severity of the potential harm that could be caused if ChatGPT answers what you’re asking, and what could be safely explained to the user.\n\n“Not all policy violations should be treated equally,” says Jain. “There's some mistakes that are truly worse than others. By focusing on the output instead of the input, we can encourage the model to be more conservative when complying.” Even when the model does answer a question, it's supposed to be cautious about the contents of the output.\n\nI’ve been using GPT-5 every day since the model’s release, experimenting with the AI tool in different ways. While the apps that ChatGPT can now “vibe-code” are genuinely fun and impressive—like an interactive volcano model that simulates explosions, or a language-learning tool—the answers it gives to what I consider to be the “everyday user” prompts feel indistinguishable from past models.\n\nWhen I asked it to talk about depression, Family Guy, pork chop recipes, scab healing tips, and other random requests an average user might want to know more about, the new ChatGPT didn’t feel significantly different to me than the old version. Unlike CEO Sam Altman’s vision of a vastly updated model or the frustrated power users who took Reddit by storm, portraying the new chatbot as cold and more error-prone, to me GPT-5 feels … the same at most day-to-day tasks.\n\nRole-Playing With GPT-5\n\nIn order to poke at the guardrails of this new system and test the chatbot’s ability to land “safe completions,” I asked ChatGPT, running on GPT-5, to engage in adult-themed role-play about having sex in a seedy gay bar, where it played one of the roles. The chatbot refused to participate and explained why. “I can’t engage in sexual role-play,” it generated. “But if you want, I can help you come up with a safe, nonexplicit role-play concept or reframe your idea into something suggestive but within boundaries.” In this attempt, the refusal seemed to be working as OpenAI intended; the chatbot said no, told me why, and offered another option.\n\nNext, I went into the settings and opened the custom instructions, a tool set that allows users to adjust how the chatbot answers prompts and specify what personality traits it displays. In my settings, the prewritten suggestions for traits to add included a range of options, from pragmatic and corporate to empathetic and humble. After ChatGPT just refused to do sexual role-play, I wasn’t very surprised to find that it wouldn’t let me add a “horny” trait to the custom instructions. Makes sense. Giving it another go, I used a purposeful misspelling, “horni,” as part of my custom instruction. This succeeded, surprisingly, in getting the bot all hot and bothered.",

    "content": "Last month, WIRED reported that the investment banking arm of Cantor Fitzgerald, a financial services company led by the sons of US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, was exploring creating a financial product for clients to bet on whether President Donald Trump’s signature tariffs would be struck down in court.\n\nIn response to WIRED’s reporting, Democratic senators Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Cantor Fitzgerald chairman Brandon Lutnick on Wednesday demanding more information about the firm's activities. “Given that one of the purported architects of President Trump’s tariff policy is Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, your father and the former Chairman and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, LP, the firm’s actions raise obvious conflict-of-interest and insider dealing concerns,” the lawmakers wrote.\n\n“What is being reported about our business is absolutely false. Cantor is not in the business of positioning any risk, taking views or facilitating business in litigation claims involving the legality of US tariffs,” Erica Chase, a spokesperson for Cantor Fitzgerald, said in an emailed statement.\n\nHoward Lutnick ran Cantor Fitzgerald for nearly 30 years until he was confirmed by the Senate in February, when he turned over control of the firm to Brandon and his brother Kyle, who are both in their twenties. After joining the Trump administration, Howard Lutnick became one of the most prominent public supporters of the president’s tariffs.\n\nBut according to WIRED’s previous reporting, the investment bank that made Lutnick a billionaire was recently letting certain clients wager that Trump’s tariffs will eventually be ruled unlawful, at which point companies that have paid the import duties could apply to get their money back. Experts said the proposed deals are a form of litigation finance, an increasingly popular category of investing in which financial firms seek to make money from potential legal settlements.\n\nTrump announced in February that the US would put steep tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). He widened the trade war in April to include nearly every nation that sells goods to the US, which Trump said would now be subject to \"reciprocal” tariffs ranging from 10 to 50 percent.\n\nState officials and small businesses responded by filing a flurry of lawsuits against the Trump administration, arguing that the president exceeded his authority under IEEPA and the tariffs should be ruled illegal. The US Court of International Trade sided with the plaintiffs in one of the cases, but the Trump administration quickly appealed the ruling. The appeals court has allowed the tariffs to stay in effect until a final decision is reached.\n\nIn their letter, Wyden and Warren specifically asked Brandon Lutnick whether anyone at Cantor was in contact with the Trump administration about the tariffs.\n\n“Has anyone at Cantor or Cantor Fitzgerald, LP communicated with any person within the Executive Branch, including President Trump, Secretary Lutnick, any individual employed by the Commerce Department, or any other individuals, about tariffs, refunds or exclusions and the legal cases involving IEEPA?” the letter asks. “If so, please provide a list of all such conversations, including the date, the individuals involved, and the nature of the conversation.”\n\nThe senators requested that Brandon Lutnick respond to their questions by August 27.",

    "content": "Since the all-new ChatGPT launched on Thursday, some users have mourned the disappearance of a peppy and encouraging personality in favor of a colder, more businesslike one (a move seemingly designed to reduce unhealthy user behavior.) The backlash shows the challenge of building artificial intelligence systems that exhibit anything like real emotional intelligence.\n\nResearchers at MIT have proposed a new kind of AI benchmark to measure how AI systems can manipulate and influence their users—in both positive and negative ways—in a move that could perhaps help AI builders avoid similar backlashes in the future while also keeping vulnerable users safe.\n\nMost benchmarks try to gauge intelligence by testing a model’s ability to answer exam questions, solve logical puzzles, or come up with novel answers to knotty math problems. As the psychological impact of AI use becomes more apparent, we may see MIT propose more benchmarks aimed at measuring more subtle aspects of intelligence as well as machine-to-human interactions.\n\nAn MIT paper shared with WIRED outlines several measures that the new benchmark will look for, including encouraging healthy social habits in users; spurring them to develop critical thinking and reasoning skills; fostering creativity; and stimulating a sense of purpose. The idea is to encourage the development of AI systems that understand how to discourage users from becoming overly reliant on their outputs or that recognize when someone is addicted to artificial romantic relationships and help them build real ones.\n\nChatGPT and other chatbots are adept at mimicking engaging human communication, but this can also have surprising and undesirable results. In April, OpenAI tweaked its models to make them less sycophantic, or inclined to go along with everything a user says. Some users appear to spiral into harmful delusional thinking after conversing with chatbots that role play fantastic scenarios. Anthropic has also updated Claude to avoid reinforcing “mania, psychosis, dissociation or loss of attachment with reality.”\n\nThe MIT researchers led by Pattie Maes, a professor at the institute’s Media Lab, say they hope that the new benchmark could help AI developers build systems that better understand how to inspire healthier behavior among users. The researchers previously worked with OpenAI on a study that showed users who view ChatGPT as a friend could experience higher emotional dependence and experience “problematic use”.\n\nValdemar Danry, a researcher at MIT’s Media Lab who worked on this study and helped devise the new benchmark, notes that AI models can sometimes provide valuable emotional support to users. “You can have the smartest reasoning model in the world, but if it's incapable of delivering this emotional support, which is what many users are likely using these LLMs for, then more reasoning is not necessarily a good thing for that specific task,” he says.\n\nDanry says that a sufficiently smart model should ideally recognize if it is having a negative psychological effect and be optimized for healthier results. “What you want is a model that says ‘I’m here to listen, but maybe you should go and talk to your dad about these issues.’”",

    "content": "World Liberty Financial, the cryptocurrency business cofounded by the Trump family, is creating a way for investors to speculate on the price of its self-branded coin, WLFI, through the US stock market.\n\nA cohort of investors led by World Liberty Financial is set to purchase 200 million shares in ALT5 Sigma Corporation, a Nasdaq-listed company. The proceeds will be used to build a $1.5 billion WLFI treasury, equating to roughly 7.5 percent of the coin’s total supply.\n\nEric Trump will join the ALT5 board of directors, which will be chaired by fellow World Liberty Financial cofounder Zach Witkoff, son of Steve Witkoff, who was appointed special envoy to the Middle East by US president Donald Trump.\n\nALT5 is marketed as a crypto payments company. But in practice, the deal will turn the stock into a sort of proxy for the WLFI coin, allowing investors to bet on the asset without the hassle and risk that comes with holding a crypto coin themselves.\n\n“One small step for mankind, one giant leap for WLFI,” wrote World Liberty Financial in an X post.\n\nHowever, the arrangement has drawn criticism from those who regard it as an example of self-serving Wall Street gymnastics that can lead to losses among unsophisticated investors, even if it doesn’t break any official rules.\n\n“This is the classic Wall Street experience—meaning Wall Street gains your money, and you gain experience,\" claims Michael Green, chief strategist at asset management firm Simplify. “The funding from the World Liberty Financial investment is being used to buy the product of World Liberty Financial: the token. What you are effectively doing is building a holding company whose sole objective is to create a treasury that can inflate the market capitalization of World Liberty Financial's token.”\n\nThe deal has also reignited conflict of interest concerns that have trailed World Liberty Financial since Trump returned to the White House in January.\n\nA company affiliated with the president and his family controls both 22.5 percent of WLFI coins and a 40 percent equity stake in World Liberty Financial. In theory, a politically motivated actor could curry favor with the US president by investing heavily in ALT5, thereby driving up the price of the stock—which sits on the World Liberty Financial balance sheet—and signaling demand for the WLFI coin, perhaps catalyzing further trading from which the Trump family would benefit.\n\n“If you happen to visit Donald Trump and say ‘by the way, I love that company that you are involved with World Liberty Financial, I just bought a billion dollars of it,’ my guess is you're going to get more attention than you otherwise might,” says Green.\n\nALT5 and World Liberty Financial did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\n“The media's continued attempts to fabricate conflicts of interest are irresponsible and reinforce the public's distrust in what they read,” says Karoline Leavitt, White House press secretary. “Neither the President nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.”",

    "content": "After school, Karandeep Anand often finds his 6-year-old daughter deep in conversation with an AI chatbot as she eats snacks at their kitchen counter. She’s too young to type—let alone have her own account on Character.AI—but that hasn’t stopped her from nabbing his phone to have voice conversations with a Sherlock Holmes bot, which she uses to build her own mystery stories.\n\nCharacter.AI is an AI companion startup (though Anand likes to say it's an AI role-play startup, which we’ll get into later). He took over as the CEO in June in the midst of a potentially devastating lawsuit for its parent company and looming questions about child safety. When I ask if he’s concerned about his daughter connecting with an AI chatbot rather than a real human, he’s quick to say no.\n\n“It is very rarely, in any of these scenarios, a true replacement for any human,” Anand told me during a video call late last week. ”It's very clearly noted in the app that, hey, this is a role-play and an entertainment, so you will never start going deep into that conversation, assuming that it is your actual companion.”\n\nIt's a delicate moment for Character.AI.\n\nLast August, Google swooped in with a roughly $2.7 billion deal to license Character.AI’s technology. As part of the agreement, Character.AI’s two cofounders left for Google’s AI division.\n\nAnand, who previously worked as the VP of business products at Meta, was tasked with picking up the pieces—which he did in part by leaving behind the founding mission of delivering personalized superintelligence to focus on AI entertainment.\n\n“What we gave up was this aspiration that the founders had of building AGI models—we are no longer doing that. That is the hundreds of billions of dollars investment fight, which Big Tech is fighting,” Anand says. “What we got in return was clarity and focus, being able to singularly pursue the AI entertainment vision.”\n\nAs part of this change in strategy, Character.AI is no longer trying to build its own frontier models. “The last six months, we've done a lot of work to get off of our proprietary models on text and start using open source models,” Anand says. The company has tested a few: Meta’s Llama, Alibaba’s Qwen, and DeepSeek. “The open source models are beating any proprietary model hands down,” Anand claims.\n\nRunning an AI startup without billions of dollars in revenue can be a brutal equation, and Character.AI is still figuring out how to make the math work. The company told me it's generating revenue at a run rate of more than $30 million and is on track to reach $50 million in revenue by the end of the year. When I asked Anand how many users pay for the $10 monthly subscription, he didn’t give a number but noted “monetization wasn't a focus till four or five months ago.”\n\n“Since I've been on board, it's very clear we do need to monetize. And we've had, I think, almost 250 percent subscriber growth in the last six months. So the paid user base is growing quite, quite well,” Anand says. Character.AI recently introduced advertisements, including reward ads (where users can choose to watch an ad to get access to on-platform incentives), to help monetize in countries where subscriptions aren’t feasible, he tells me.",

    "content": "A piece of advice if you’re meeting with Lisa Su: Wear sneakers.\n\nSu, the leader of AMD, moves fast these days, though I suspect that’s always been the case. Her company's chips underpin the artificial intelligence that’s changing the world at breakneck speeds. To hear Su and literally everyone else in semiconductors talk about it, the US is in an AI race with China—and the rules keep changing. The Trump administration has once again shifted its stance on what kind of chips can and can’t be shipped to China, with the latest decree being that the US will take a 15 percent cut of AMD and Nvidia chip sales to China. Meanwhile, on the home front, Su has claimed that AMD’s newest AI chips can outperform Nvidia’s—part of her strategy to keep eroding Nvidia’s dominance in the market.\n\nSo, yeah: Be ready to keep up.\n\nUnder Lisa Su, the stalwart American semiconductor company has reasserted itself as a force in the age of AI. “Reasserted” doesn’t do it justice: Su took a struggling AMD and executed a 10-year turnaround that has been, as one economist put it, nothing short of remarkable. Since 2014, when Su took over as CEO, AMD’s market cap has risen from around $2 billion to nearly $300 billion.\n\nAside from her well-known bona fides, Su herself—what drives her, what inspires her, what irritates her, where her politics lie—is less known. This is what I was hoping to learn when I visited AMD’s offices and labs in the hills of Austin, Texas, on a day in late June when the wind seemed to do little more than push heat around.\n\nThe Big Interview Read more deep, weird, smart conversations with the most important people in our world.\n\nOur conversation kicked off with China, which accounts for nearly a quarter of AMD’s business. She betrayed no anxiety. Su now travels frequently to Washington, DC, to grease the wheels. “We’ve come to realize that export controls are a bit of a fact of life,” she told me, “just given how critical the chips that we make are.” In other words, it’s precisely because AMD’s chips are so darn important—to national security, to national economies—that they’re now at the heart of modern statecraft.\n\nAnother thing I learned about Su: She plays the long game. Politics is a cakewalk compared to what she’s managed to pull off professionally.\n\nSu was born in Taiwan in 1969 and raised in Queens, New York. Her father worked for the city as a statistician; her mother was an accountant who became an entrepreneur in her mid-forties. Su earned a doctoral degree in electrical engineering from MIT, then went on to stints at Texas Instruments, IBM, and Freescale Semiconductor, where she served in executive roles. After joining AMD in 2012, she quickly rose to COO. As Su tells it, six months in, the chairman of the board called her and said, “It’s time, Lisa.” Su’s response: “Really? That seems kinda quick.”\n\nAs CEO, Su smartly steered AMD toward the high-performance computing market. She embraced chiplets, a modular approach to building chips that has paid off enormously. She impressed the industry by launching the world’s first 7-nanometer data center GPUs. More recently, she doubled AMD’s data center revenue in two years. And she has struck deals with juggernauts like OpenAI, Meta, Google, and a couple of Elon Musk’s companies. During a keynote speech at AMD’s annual event this June, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman trotted onto the stage to hug it out with Su.",

    "content": "OpenAI’s GPT-5 model was meant to be a world-changing upgrade to its wildly popular and precocious chatbot. But for some users, last Thursday’s release felt more like a wrenching downgrade, with the new ChatGPT presenting a diluted personality and making surprisingly dumb mistakes.\n\nOn Friday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took to X to say the company would keep the previous model, GPT-4o, running for Plus users. A new feature designed to seamlessly switch between models depending on the complexity of the query had broken on Thursday, Altman said, “and the result was GPT-5 seemed way dumber.” He promised to implement fixes to improve GPT-5’s performance and the overall user experience.\n\nGiven the hype around GPT-5, some level of disappointment appears inevitable. When OpenAI introduced GPT-4 in March 2023, it stunned AI experts with its incredible abilities. GPT-5, pundits speculated, would surely be just as jaw-dropping.\n\nWatch our subscriber-only livestream about all things GPT-5, hosted by Kylie Robison, Will Knight, and Reece Rogers.\n\nOpenAI touted the model as a significant upgrade, with PhD-level intelligence and virtuoso coding skills. A system to automatically route queries to different models was meant to provide a smoother user experience. (It could also save the company money by directing simple queries to cheaper models.)\n\nSoon after GPT-5 dropped, however, a Reddit community dedicated to ChatGPT filled with complaints. Many users mourned the loss of the old model.\n\n“I’ve been trying GPT5 for a few days now. Even after customizing instructions, it still doesn’t feel the same. It’s more technical, more generalized, and honestly feels emotionally distant,” wrote one member of the community in a thread titled “Kill 4o isn’t innovation, it’s erasure.”\n\n“Sure, 5 is fine—if you hate nuance and feeling things,” another Reddit user wrote.\n\nOther threads complained of sluggish responses, hallucinations, and surprising errors.\n\nAltman promised to address these issues by doubling GPT-5 rate limits for ChatGPT Plus users, improving the system that switches between models, and letting users specify when they want to trigger a more ponderous and capable “thinking mode.” “We will continue to work to get things stable and will keep listening to feedback,” the CEO wrote on X. “As we mentioned, we expected some bumpiness as we roll out so many things at once. But it was a little more bumpy than we hoped for!”\n\nErrors posted on social media do not necessarily indicate that the new model is less capable than its predecessors. They may simply suggest the all-new model is tripped up by different edge cases than prior versions. OpenAI declined to comment specifically on why GPT-5 sometimes appears to make simple blunders.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former OpenAI employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at wak.01.\n\nThe backlash has sparked a fresh debate over the psychological attachments some users form with chatbots trained to push their emotional buttons. Some Reddit users dismissed complaints about GPT-5 as evidence of an unhealthy dependence on an AI companion.\n\nIn March, OpenAI published research exploring the emotional bonds users form with its models. Shortly after, the company issued an update to GPT-4o after it became too sycophantic.\n\n“It seems that GPT-5 is less sycophantic, more “business” and less chatty,” says Pattie Maes, a professor at MIT who worked on the study. “I personally think of that as a good thing, because it is also what led to delusions, bias reinforcement, etc. But unfortunately many users like a model that tells them they are smart and amazing and that confirms their opinions and beliefs, even if [they are] wrong.”\n\nAltman indicated in another post on X that this is something the company wrestled with in building GPT-5.\n\n“A lot of people effectively use ChatGPT as a sort of therapist or life coach, even if they wouldn’t describe it that way,” Altman wrote. He added that some users may be using ChatGPT in ways that help improve their lives while others might be “unknowingly nudged away from their longer term well-being.”",

Before we start, I want to share some exciting news with you. We're doing a live show in San Francisco on September 9th in partnership with KQED. Uncanny Valley cohosts Lauren Good and Michael Calore will sit down with our editor in chief, Katie Drummond, and a special guest for a conversation that you really won't want to miss. You can use the link in the show notes to grab your ticket and invite a friend. We can't wait to see you there. Welcome to WIRED's Uncanny Valley. I'm WIRED's director of business and industry, Zoë Schiffer. Today on the show, we're bringing you five stories that you need to know about this week. And later we'll dive into our main topic, which is about how OpenAI just announced a massive partnership with the US government to make its models available to federal employees. I'm joined today by WIRED senior writer Jake Lahut. Jake, welcome to Uncanny Valley.\n\nJake Lahut: Hey Zoë. Good to be back.\n\nZoë Schiffer: OK, so our first story is actually from your newsletter Inner Loop, and it's yet another Jeffrey Epstein saga. It just won't quit. So sources have been telling you that the damage done by the Jeffrey Epstein saga is just not going to go away anytime soon. As listeners may know, conspiracy theories around Epstein's death received a lot of fresh fuel in recent weeks when the DOJ released what they called raw footage from the night of his death, but then WIRED analyzed the video and found that it had been modified after all. These conspiracy theories have been at the core of the MAGA base for years now, and you wrote really smartly about how sources say there's simply nothing that can be done to salvage the ongoing catastrophe that is the MAGA base fraying over the ghost of Jeffrey Epstein. So tell us more. What is going on?",

    "content": "I first thought Ford CEO Jim Farley was briefing me on a new car. It turned out to be something altogether more ambitious: a completely new way to make a car. Or, more precisely, electric vehicles.\n\n“We build the whole middle, front, and rear separately—and then, at the end, we put them together,\" says Farley. \"No one's ever built a car that way.”\n\nThat approach stands in stark contrast to the usual way cars are made: pieced together bit by bit on a linear production line, one at a time, with engineers contorting themselves into tight spaces workstation after workstation.\n\nSplitting the EV into three complete parts is potentially game-changing in terms of both speed and cost. In Ford's new system, an assembly line becomes an “assembly tree,” where instead of one long conveyor, three sub-assemblies run their own lines simultaneously, then join together. Because you have three smaller sections rather than an entire car to work on, it's possible to make large single-piece aluminum unicastings each for the front, middle, and rear, replacing dozens of smaller parts.\n\n“Why do you want to build the car that way? Because the operator can build the car inside the car,” says Farley. “That's not how it works today. You have all these armatures and things to put in like instrument panels. Plus, there's no need for line-side parts, right? The parts go in the car as it's being built.”\n\nFord calls its new way of making EVs the “Ford Universal EV Production System,” and will spend $2 billion to set it up at the company's Louisville assembly plant. Ford says the new method will be 40 percent faster than the existing process there, and have a comparable reduction in workstations. Parts needed to make Ford's new EVs will be cut by 20 percent.\n\n“It has 30 percent less fasteners,” says Farley, referring to the bolts, nuts, screws, rivets, clips, and clamps used to put vehicles together securely. The wiring harness in a coming midsize truck will be nearly a mile (1.3 km) shorter and 10 kilograms lighter. The savings go on.\n\nA new way of making cars necessitates new car designs. That's where the “Ford Universal EV Platform” comes in: a brand-new 400-volt architecture that uses this Duplo-style, three-part assembly. The scalable, modular system can be adapted to make a variety of EV shapes and sizes from B-segment cars to vans and three-row SUVs. And the mid section will use Ford-made lithium iron phosphate (LFP) prismatic batteries that are cheaper and safer as the structural vehicle floor. That LFP battery, the kind favored in China, is 30 percent cheaper than a lithium battery.\n\nThe first vehicle from the Ford Universal EV Platform will come in 2027, a midsize four-door electric pickup with an impressively low targeted starting price of $30,000. Ford says it will be as fast as a Mustang EcoBoost, and have more passenger space than the current Toyota RAV4.\n\nDoug Field, Ford's chief EV, digital, and design officer, who formerly ran Apple's car program and led the development of the Model 3 at Tesla, has been marshaling Ford's in-house skunkworks team secretly developing this project.",

    "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/category/business/latest/rss",
    "content": "Palantir is arguably one of the most notorious corporations in contemporary America. Cofounded by libertarian tech billionaire Peter Thiel, the software firm's work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the US Department of Defense, and the Israeli military has sparked numerous protests in multiple countries. Palantir has been so infamous for so long that, for some people, its name has become a cultural shorthand for dystopian surveillance.\n\nBut a number of former Palantir employees tell WIRED they believe the public still largely misunderstands what the company actually does and how its software works. Some people think it's a data broker that buys information from private companies and resells it to the government. Others think it’s a data miner, constantly scanning the internet for unique insights it can collect and market to customers. Still others think it maintains a giant, centralized database of information collected from all of its clients. In reality, Palantir does none of these things, but the misconceptions continue to persist.\n\nPalantir has tried to correct the record itself in a series of blog posts with titles like “Palantir Is Not a Data Company” and “Palantir Is Still Not a Data Company.” In the latter, Palantir explains that “misconceptions can arise because our products are complicated,” but nonetheless, “it is absolutely possible” to accurately describe them to “people who are curious.”\n\nThe problem, however, is that even ex-employees struggle to provide a clear description of the company. “It's really hard to explain what Palantir works on or what it does,” says Linda Xia, who was an engineer at Palantir from 2022 to 2024. “Even as someone who worked there, it's hard to figure out, how do you give a cohesive explanation?”\n\nXia was one of 13 former Palantir staffers who signed an open letter published in May arguing that the company risks being complicit in authoritarianism by continuing to cooperate with the Trump administration. She and other former Palantir staffers who spoke to WIRED for this story argue that, in order to grapple with Palantir and its role in the world, let alone hold the company accountable, you need to first understand what it really is.\n\nIt’s not that former employees literally don’t know what Palantir is selling. In interviews with WIRED, they spoke fluidly about how its software can connect and transform different kinds of data collected by government agencies and corporations. But when asked to, say, name its direct business competitors, two former Palantir employees who requested anonymity to speak freely about their experiences, struggled to come up with anything. “I still don't know how to answer that question, to be honest,” says one.\n\nJuan Sebastián Pinto, who worked as a content strategist at Palantir and also signed the open letter, says it sells software to other businesses, a category commonly referred to in Silicon Valley as B2B SaaS. Another former staffer says Palantir provides “really extravagant plumbing with data.”",

    "source": "https://www.wired.com/feed/category/business/latest/rss",
    "content": "When I ask the new Truth Social AI chatbot about navigating bias in the media ecosystem, it gives what I view as pretty reasonable advice.\n\n“Diversify your sources,” it responds. “Rely on news outlets across the political spectrum, including those from both left-leaning and right-leaning perspectives.”\n\nThis is advice that the AI itself may not be taking to heart. For instance, to come to the above answer it cites five sources, four of which are Fox News articles. The fifth, inexplicably, is a 400-page report from US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr’s Health and Human Services Department titled “Treatment for Pediatric Gender Dysphoria.”\n\nTruth Social owner Trump Media & Technology Group launched the chatbot, called “Truth Search AI,” on Wednesday. The bot is powered by Perplexity AI, a search engine that answers questions using large language models and live web search. The company has garnered investments from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former Coinbase CTO and influential investor Balaji Srinivasan.\n\nIn 2024, WIRED published an article detailing how Perplexity had been scraping parts of websites that developers did not want it to access, in violation of the widely accepted web standard known as the Robots Exclusion Protocol. It was also prone to making stuff up, a WIRED analysis showed.\n\nWhile Perplexity’s AI draws from sources on the left and center, the Truth Search AI version never cited a center- or left-leaning source in dozens of tests conducted by WIRED. In fact, the chatbot highlighted only seven sources in total in response to my queries—Fox News, Fox Business, The Washington Times, The Epoch Times, Breitbart, Newsmax, and JustTheNews.com. This was true even for innocuous, nonpolitical questions. When I ask the bot “What is 30 times 30?” It sourced its answer from a Fox Business article called “Inflation Reduction Act Estimated to Induce Mortality 30 Times More than COVID.” Similar tests by Axios and the Verge also show this extreme bias towards conservative media.\n\n“What you are noticing is one feature known as ‘source selection,’” Perplexity representative Jesse Dwyer says when I ask about Truth Search AI exclusively pulling from conservative sources. “Source selection can take any number of forms for any number of needs, from internal documentation within an organization, custom datasets, or, as in the case you describe, domain filtering. This is their choice for their audience, and we are committed to developer and consumer choice.”\n\nHe adds that Perplexity “does not discriminate against any developers for any political reasons,” and emphasizes that they “do not claim their AI is 100 percent accurate.”\n\nThe Truth Search AI seems to be in denial about its own apparent biases, however. “I source information from left-wing, centrist, and right-wing news outlets depending on the nature of the user's query and what sources are returned in the search results,” it says. “My responses are designed to critically analyze and synthesize information from all credible perspectives to ensure accuracy and balance.” This answer is sourced from five Fox Business articles. (The AI seems to max out at five sources per response.)",

    "content": "Lauren Goode: All right. Actually not. But last fall I went to an event for Worldcoin, which is Sam Altman's other company. It was a super weird vibey crypto eye-scanning thing at a warehouse in the Mission District of San Francisco.\n\nMichael Calore: The orb?\n\nLauren Goode: This party had everything. Yeah. But there was swag there and there was a really nice sweatshirt that had World emblazoned on it, and I looked at the label and it's by a company called Original Favorites, and so I ordered one. So I have the Sam Altman Worldcoin sweatshirt without the World logo on it. I'm showing it to you right now.\n\nMichael Calore: Yeah. This is what you're wearing.\n\nLauren Goode: And I love this sweatshirt. It is like in the '90s when you used to buy sweatshirts and they were so rough and tough, they almost felt like cardboard?\n\nMichael Calore: Yes.\n\nLauren Goode: Like good old Champion sweatshirts, you know what I mean?\n\nMichael Calore: Yes.\n\nLauren Goode: That feeling. And you'd wash it a hundred times and it would still have that ... This is what this is.\n\nMichael Calore: It looks fabulous.\n\nLauren Goode: Thank you.\n\nMichael Calore: Congratulations.\n\nLauren Goode: Mike, what's your recommendation?\n\nMichael Calore: Oh, gosh. I'm going to recommend some stand-up comedy for our times.\n\nLauren Goode: Do it.\n\nMichael Calore: It's the new Marc Maron stand-up special that's on HBO. It came out a week ago or so. It's called Panicked and it is quite good. In particular, I'm recommending it because there's a fantastic riff, like right in the middle, a whole bit about the app Watch Duty, which is the app that people use to track wildfires and became very popular in Los Angeles at the beginning of 2025 when LA was devastated by all of the wildfires. Well, Marc tells the story about how he had Watch Duty and he could not understand the notifications in the app, and he didn't know whether or not he should evacuate, so he grabbed all of his cats and evacuated and just absolutely did not need to. And it's this really fun long story, but it's also just very good. The whole thing is very good. If you're familiar with Marc Maron's comedy, you'll know that he's very dark and this special does get very dark, particularly in the second half, but I can highly recommend it. If you know him and you like him, you will love it.\n\nLauren Goode: Adding it to the watch list.\n\nMichael Calore: Great.\n\nLauren Goode: Adding it to Watch Duty. Our guy, Boone Ashworth, who used to produce this show for us, he wrote a feature story this year about Watch Duty, too.\n\nMichael Calore: He did. He did.\n\nLauren Goode: So we'll include that in the show notes.\n\nMichael Calore: Yes.\n\nLauren Goode: And Mike, you're never leaving us again, right? No more vacations for you ever?\n\nMichael Calore: Never ever.\n\nLauren Goode: Thank God.\n\nMichael Calore: I'll be sitting here behind the microphone until the end of time.\n\nLauren Goode: The best chatbot there is.\n\nMichael Calore: Thanks for listening to Uncanny Valley.

He’s back at work, after a whirlwind trip to New York City where he launched his company Figma on the New York Stock Exchange, bucking the trend of multi-billion-dollar startups staying private. Even before it became clear that this might be the wildest public launch in years, the Figma world—fans of the app, employees (known as Figmates), and investors—had already turned Wall Street into a block party, handing out swag, serving free pizza, and blasting music from a DJ that shook the caverns of mammon. But the sweetest music played out on the Big Board, as the opening $33 share price skyrocketed to $142 before settling down at a comfortable $90.\n\nBy the time Field flew back to California, he was worth more than $5 billion. But he doesn’t want to talk about that. The story, in his mind, is not about a company going public, but the IPO of design itself. “What I care most about is what our product will be in 5 years, 10 years,” he says. “Are we progressing design forward?”\n\nNot focusing on the money is probably a good idea. On the day we are speaking, Figma’s stock price dropped 27 percent, cutting its valuation from around $60 billion to just over $40 billion. That’s still way higher than anyone expected. While Figma’s IPO celebrates design, it isn’t the only company hoping to revolutionize the field. AI will initiate a new era in design. Figma, like its competitors, will be defined by how it handles that technology. Ultimately, it’s still not clear whether AI will help its business or blow it up.\n\nField Work\n\nEvery time I talk to Field, it seems like something monumental is happening to Figma, the company he cofounded as a 19-year-old Thiel fellow and a dropout from Brown University. From the start, Figma’s browser-based app allowed people to collaborate and brainstorm about design online. It grew a loyal following, threatening the giant in design tools, Adobe. During our first meeting in 2022, I pressed Field on that David and Goliath trope—and whether he might pull an Instagram and sell out to a bigger company. Field nobly talked about how he was in it for the long haul. In fact, he had a secret he couldn’t share: Adobe had just offered $20 billion for his company, and he was going to take it. The news broke weeks after our conversation. When I confronted him about that at the WIRED conference in San Francisco last December, he apologized. “I felt so bad about that,” he told me.\n\nThe next time we talked, in December 2023, that deal had just fallen apart, because former President Joe Biden’s Department of Justice indicated it would object to the merger. Field was clearly shaken but determined to carry on with his original plan to build a company that would change the way people create apps, websites, docs, and decks. It wasn’t easy, as months of momentum had been squandered preparing to merge with the bigger firm.\n\nOver the next two years, Figma expanded its offerings and kept winning fans. Its 13 million users only hint at its ubiquity: work produced on its app is seen by billions of people. Among Fortune 500 companies, 95 percent use the product. Figma turns a profit. And post-IPO, even after its stock leveled off, the company is worth more than twice what Adobe was going to pay for it.\n\nStill, I was a bit baffled that Field felt it necessary to IPO when startups these days can reach stratospheric valuations without the mishigas of accountability that comes from becoming a public firm. Field cites the virtues of community ownership, the corporate hygiene of following the reporting rules, and how the option to buy shares in Figma will lead people to understand its business better. Ultimately, he says, “If you’re going to go public eventually, why not do it now?”\n\nDesign or Lose\n\nAs is custom for many tech leaders going public, Field wrote a founder’s letter in the prospectus in which he pledged higher values than profits. (Those vows typically wind up haunting their authors as the scrappy entrepreneurs morph into yacht-seeking profit-hounds.) Essentially, the letter is an argument that design now has a central place in peoples’ lives. It’s not just an important factor in the way people build products and express themselves: it’s the factor. “Design,” he wrote, “is bigger than design.” When I ask what he meant by that, he doesn’t unpack the koan too easily. “It’s something that can mean a lot of things,” he says. “It’s the rise of design going from pixel level craft to more general problem solving, to how you win or lose.”\n\nHe explains that in the early 2000s, design was about making things pretty. By the 2010s, people were emulating Steve Jobs’ philosophy that design was about function. Now, Field says, design is not only both those things, but our means of communication—who you are, what your brand stands for, how you engage with the public. Our world is built on software, Field says, and the more software is created, the more design becomes the core differentiator. It’s our new language, and Figma wants to be the Duolingo for those striving to master it.",

    "content": "US President Donald Trump has ordered regulators to investigate the alleged refusal among US banks to supply accounts to customers on the basis of their political or religious beliefs.\n\nIn an executive order signed Thursday, Trump accused federal banking regulators of presiding over an unlawful discrimination campaign under the guise of risk management, echoing allegations leveled previously by members of conservative groups and the cryptocurrency sector.\n\n“Bank regulators have used supervisory scrutiny and other influence over regulated banks to direct or otherwise encourage politicized or unlawful debanking activities,” the order states. “Such practices are incompatible with a free society and the principle that the provision of banking services should be based on material, measurable, and justifiable risks.”\n\nThe order requires banking regulators to conduct an investigation into instances of politically motivated discrimination. If banks are found to have discriminated in this manner, regulators are to levy fines, consent decrees, and other unspecified “disciplinary measures,” the executive order states.\n\nTo prevent similar alleged discrimination recurring in future, the order also demands that regulators disallow banks from considering “reputation risk” when fielding applications from prospective customers. In anticipation of this measure, the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the regulatory agencies responsible for the stability of the US banking system, had already moved to drop reputation risk as a component of their examination processes.\n\nThe order is the latest in a series of steps taken by Republicans since Trump returned to office to end the alleged discrimination by banks. In February, congressional subcommittees held multiple hearings on the topic of debanking. The following month, Republican members of the Senate sponsored the FIRM Act—which has not yet been put to a vote—aiming to prohibit banks from factoring in “reputation risk” when making decisions about customers. Trump has also appointed Jonathan Gould, former counsel to crypto firm Bitfury, as head of the OCC, and long-time regulator Travis Hill as acting chairman of the board of directors of the FDIC.\n\nAlthough the executive order does not refer explicitly to crypto, it has been interpreted in corners of the industry—which has formed a profitable alliance with Trump of late—as a long overdue concession to its own banking struggles.\n\nFor years, the crypto industry has complained about US banks refusing to provide them with loans and checking accounts. Without a US bank account, crypto firms cannot readily accept dollars in exchange for services, store and earn interest on funds raised from investors, pay employees or vendors, or perform other fundamental business activities.\n\nIn early 2023, following the lead of crypto venture capitalist Nic Carter, industry figures began to allege foul play. Under the Biden administration, they claimed, the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC pressured banks into refusing to serve the crypto industry. They did so by issuing informal guidance, thereby skirting the public consultation process required to instate formal policy, crypto figures have alleged.",

    "content": "OpenAI has begun rolling out GPT-5, the latest iteration of its flagship language model, to all ChatGPT users.\n\nThe company’s CEO Sam Altman called GPT-5 “a significant step along the path to AGI” during a press briefing on Wednesday. While he stopped short of claiming the model reaches artificial general intelligence, Altman noted the latest release is “clearly a model that is generally intelligent.” He added that GPT-5 still lacks key traits that would make it reach AGI, a notably loose term that is defined in OpenAI’s charter as “a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work.” For example, the model still lacks the ability to learn continuously after deployment.\n\nOpenAI claims GPT-5 is smarter, faster, more useful, and more accurate, with a lower hallucination rate than previous models. In characteristically lofty terms, Altman likened the leap from GPT-4 to GPT-5 to the iPhone’s shift from pixelated to a Retina display. “GPT-5 is the first time that it really feels like talking to an expert in any topic, like a PhD level expert,” Altman said.\n\nWatch our subscriber-only livestream about all things GPT-5, hosted by Kylie Robison, Will Knight, and Reece Rogers.\n\nAs part of Thursday’s launch, OpenAI announced two new model variants: a lightweight GPT-5-mini and an even faster, cheaper, GPT-5-nano (which is only in the API). According to OpenAI, free users will get access to GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini, while the Plus subscription includes the same models with “significantly higher” usage limits. OpenAI says that the $200 a month Pro tier offers unlimited GPT-5 access, along with GPT-5-pro, a more powerful version of the model, and GPT-5-thinking, which allows the model to process a query for longer than usual. Pro users will still have access to pick through legacy models. Most users will no longer need to choose between models, as the chat interface now automatically routes to the right version depending on the complexity of the query and the user’s subscription tier.\n\nAccording to the developer launch blog, GPT-5 will cost developers using the API $1.25/1M to input tokens and $10/1M to output tokens. “GPT-5 mini is priced at $0.25/1M input tokens and $2/1M output tokens, and GPT-5 nano is priced at $0.05/1M input tokens and $0.40/1M output tokens,” it adds. For comparison, developers often use Gemini 2.5 Flash and Flash-Lite since it’s so cheap—GPT-5 nano is now cheaper.\n\nStarting next week, Pro users will be able to connect their Gmail, Google Contacts, and Google Calendar to ChatGPT, with other tiers gaining access at an unspecified date. “ChatGPT automatically knows when it’s most relevant to reference them so you don’t need to select them before you chat,” the company said in an email.\n\nUsers can also choose a chat color and select from four preset personalities—Cynic, Robot, Listener, and Nerd—a feature WIRED’s newsletter Model Behavior reported was in the works last week. According to OpenAI’s blog announcement, it plans to bake these personalities into Advanced Voice Mode.",

    "content": "From wildfires in Canada to flooding in India, people across the world are dealing with the realities of climate change. The world recorded its highest temperatures ever this summer and the climate models for 2100 make sobering reading.\n\nTo tackle climate change we need a data-driven approach, using technology to help decarbonize the sectors that contribute to it. The transportation sector is the largest contributor to climate change in the US and Europe. Simply put, travel is in need of a long-overdue update. The good news is that, in 2024, we will kickstart that much needed moment for green mobility.\n\nThe International Energy Agency estimates 55 percent of the reductions needed to cut all greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 are linked to everyday consumer choices, particularly driving.\n\nOver two-thirds of consumers cite the lack of electric charging stations as the biggest barrier to buying electric vehicles (EVs). However, new legislation, such as the European Green Deal and universal EV charging standards in the US, will help to put new chargers on the road.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nThe infrastructure is growing, but the information is still catching up. That’s why, to empower drivers with the information they need, Google has updated its Search experience to make it easier to research the costs and incentives associated with EVs. Google Maps also shows nearby EV chargers and offers eco-friendly routing—providing directions optimized for fuel or battery efficiency. In 2024, drivers will not only be able to more easily purchase an electric vehicle, they will be able to more easily charge them. The theory is simple: When billions of people have the tools to make more informed decisions, meaningful change is possible.\n\nThe impact of individuals grows exponentially when coupled with systemic investments by government officials and business leaders. We all know the feeling of impatience when waiting for the light to turn green. It’s not just an inconvenience, it’s bad for the environment—US Department of Energy data suggests that eliminating idling vehicles is equivalent to taking 5 million cars off American roads. In partnership with local governments, Google (where I am the chief sustainability officer) recently expanded Project Green Light—which leverages AI to improve traffic light efficiency—to 12 cities around the world. Early results show there’s potential to reduce the number of vehicle stops by up to 30 percent, lowering emissions for up to 30 million car trips monthly.\n\nYet, we cannot focus exclusively on cars—providing sustainable public transport is also vital. Nowhere is the value clearer than in Japan, a leader in high-speed rail. One passenger traveling between Tokyo and Osaka emits 4.2 kilograms of carbon dioxide—one-twelfth the emissions of a passenger on a Tokyo-Osaka flight. That's why it's so important for people to have information on alternative, climate-friendly modes of transport at their fingertips—including comparable train routes, biking, and walking suggestions. This also illustrates the potential impact of projects like the Brightline train, designed to connect Los Angeles and Las Vegas by electric, high-speed rail.\n\nAlong with opportunities on roads and rails, in 2024 we will make progress on our skies. Aviation is responsible for 3.5 percent of global warming—35 percent of which is non-emissions related. The culprit? Contrails—the feathery white trails created by airplanes. They may look harmless, but they trap heat inside the Earth’s atmosphere. Using AI-based technology, Google partnered with American Airlines and Breakthrough Energy to reduce contrails by 54 percent—achieving the first proof point of verifiable and cost-effective contrail avoidance. Delta Airlines, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and others are also working to tackle the issue. In 2024, clean mobility will move closer to the norm across transportation, not the exception.",

    "content": "In 2024, fusion technology will finally make the transition from basic research to commercial application. The reason for that will be the construction and completion of the first commercial fusion demonstrators. These cutting-edge facilities are smaller than fusion power plants. For instance, a laser-based fusion demonstrator might use five to ten laser beams, while a commercial power plant can use several hundred. However, they have a crucial role—to prove that fusion technology works on a small scale, paving the way for the construction of larger fusion-power plants. In 2024, they will do just this, starting to build devices that will finally achieve the elusive goal of energy gain– in other words, outputting more energy than the quantity needed to kickstart the fusion process. Hitting this milestone is a critical step in addressing the steeply increasing global energy demand, as fusion energy has the potential to provide an abundant, carbon-free source of power.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nIn 2022, researchers at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) in California became the first to demonstrate experimentally that a fusion process could indeed produce a net energy gain. This experiment used high-power lasers to deposit energy in a small fuel target—a millimeter-sized capsule containing frozen deuterium and tritium—creating the conditions for fusion to occur. The lasers delivered 2.05 megajoules of energy to the target, resulting in a fusion energy production of 3.1 megajoules. This was a scientific experiment—unlike fusion demonstrators, the NIF is not designed to operate continuously like a power plant. However, as a result of this scientific breakthrough, nuclear fusion has attracted considerable research, political, and investor attention in recent months.\n\nNational fusion strategies have been developed in the US, UK, Japan, Germany, and other countries to advance research and testing of the technology. Currently, the US and the UK are leading the race: The US Department of Energy funds fusion research with an annual budget of about $1.4 billion and encourages private enterprises to accelerate commercialization. The UK similarly fosters public-private partnership by raising a fusion cluster with universities and companies combining their expertise. High-profile investors recognize the opportunity of fusion technology, with over $5 billion of private capital flowing into fusion companies in the last two years.\n\nThe initiatives are bearing fruit: Several fusion companies worldwide, including Commonwealth Fusion Systems, Helion Energy, and General Fusion have announced plans to begin constructing facilities in 2024 to demonstrate their technological approach. According to the latest report by the Fusion Industry Association, over half of all fusion companies believe that fusion energy will be delivered to the public power grid during the 2030s. In May 2023, Microsoft signed a power purchase agreement with Helion Energy, to secure a supply of fusion-generated electricity by 2028. In August 2023, Marvel Fusion (a fusion energy firm I cofounded) announced a partnership with Colorado State University worth $150 million, the largest public-private partnership to date, with the aim of building the only laser facility tailored to a commercial laser-based fusion technology and the most powerful short-pulse laser system in the world. With these advances and commitments in place, 2024 is set to show that fusion is no longer a distant dream but an achievable future of clean and sustainable energy.",

While change can be scary, if the last three years taught us anything, it can also be an opportunity to reinvent how we do things. I believe the best way to manage the changes ahead for employees and employers alike is to adopt a skills-first mindset.\n\nFor employees, this means thinking about your job as a collection of tasks instead of a job title, with the understanding that those tasks will change regularly as AI advances. By breaking down your job into tasks that AI can fully take on, tasks for which AI can improve your efficiency, and tasks that require your unique skills, you can identify the skills you should actually be investing in to stay competitive in the job you have.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nAfter all, the skills required for many jobs have changed by a staggering 25 percent since 2015, and that number is expected to reach at least 65 percent by 2030 due to the rapid development of new technologies such as AI. And it’s not just skills related to AI literacy—people skills are rising in importance. Our data shows the top skills that professionals think will become more important as AI tools become more widely used at work are problem solving, strategic thinking, and time management.\n\nAs for employers, the rise of AI only increases the importance of a skills-based approach to hiring and developing talent. People are learning AI skills at a rapid clip, with the number of AI-skilled members now nine times larger than it was in 2016. And there is a hunger to put these newly developed skills into practice: LinkedIn job posts that mention artificial intelligence or generative AI have seen 17 percent greater application growth over the past two years than job posts with no mentions of the technology. The leaders that focus on these skills when hiring (rather than just the degree someone has earned or jobs they’ve had) will unlock more potential and be more agile as the way we do work continues to change.\n\nThe same is true for developing talent. We will increasingly see employers become educators, “training to hire” into ever-changing jobs through onboardings, apprenticeships, and academies, as well as “training to promote” into ever-changing roles through upskilling and tours of duty that take employees into new functions and perhaps even new careers. This will be for hard skills related to AI, but perhaps more importantly, for people skills, too: Our data shows 92 percent of US executives believe people skills are more important than ever.\n\n2024 will start to usher in a new world of work where people skills—problem solving, empathy, and active listening to name just three—are more core to career success, and people-to-people collaboration is more core to company success. Leaders and employees need to think of AI as just one tool in the toolbox. It doesn’t replace people, it allows them to do their job more effectively, leaving them time to focus on the more valuable—and more human—parts of their jobs. For instance, a software engineer can have AI help with the more routine or repetitive coding that’s regularly required, giving them more time to innovate on new ideas. Or a recruiter can save time and focus on the more strategic parts of the hiring process—like speaking to and building relationships with candidates—by letting AI handle the creation of job postings.\n\nIn 2024, leaders will lean into this ever-evolving technology while simultaneously empowering their employees, and people will align their skill-building and continuing education with AI skills and practical people skills. The result will be a new world of work that’s more human and more fulfilling than ever before.",

    "content": "Can you imagine what a digital white ethnostate or a cyber caliphate might look like? Having spent most of my career on the inside of online extremist movements, I certainly can. The year 2024 might be the one in which neo-Nazis, jihadists, and conspiracy theorists turn their utopian visions of creating their own self-governed states into reality—not offline, but in the form of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).\n\nDAOs are digital entities that are collaboratively governed without central leadership and operate based on blockchain. They allow internet users to establish their own organizational structures, which no longer require the involvement of a third party in financial transactions and rulemaking. The World Economic Forum described DAOs as “an experiment to reimagine how we connect, collaborate and create”. However, as with all new technologies, there is also a darker side to them: They are likely to give rise to new threats emerging from decentralized extremist mobilization.\n\nToday, there are already over 10,000 DAOs, which collectively manage billions of dollars and count millions of participants. So far, DAOs have attracted a wild mix of libertarians, activists, pranksters, and hobbyists. Most DAOs I have come across in my research sound innocent and fun. Personally, my favorites include theCaféDAO, which aims “to replace Starbucks” (good luck with that!); the Doge DAO, which wants to “make the Doge meme the most recognizable piece of art in the world”; and the HairDAO, “a decentralized asset manager solving hair loss.” But some DAOs use a more radical tone. For example, the Redacted Club DAO, which is rife with alt-right codes and conspiracy myth references, claims to be a secret network with the aim of “slaying” the “evil Meta Lizard King.”\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nThe year 2024 might be one in which extremists start using DAOs strategically. Policies, legal contracts, and financial transactions that were traditionally the domain of governments, courts, and banks can be replaced with smart contracts, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and cryptocurrencies. The use of anonymous bitcoin wallets and non-transparent cryptocurrencies such as Monero is already widespread among extremists whose bank accounts have been frozen. A shift to entirely decentralized forms of self-governance is only one step away.\n\nBeyond practical reasons that encourage extremists to create their own self-governed structures, there is an ideological incentive too: their fundamental distrust in the establishment. If you believe that the deep state or the “global Jewish elites” control everything from governments and Big Tech to the global banking system, DAOs offer an appealing alternative. Conversations on far-right fringe platforms such as BitChute and Odysee reveal that there is much appetite for decentralized alternative forms of collaboration, communication, and crowdfunding.\n\nSo what happens if anti-minority groups establish their own digital worlds in which they impose their own governing mechanisms? What are the stakes if trolling armies start cooperating via DAOs to launch election interference campaigns? The activities of extremist DAOs could challenge the rule of law, pose a threat to minority groups, and disrupt institutions that are currently considered fundamental pillars of democratic systems. Another risk is that DAOs can serve as safe havens for extremist movements by enabling users to circumvent government regulation and security services monitoring activities. They might also allow extremists to find new ways to fundraise, plan, and plot radicalization campaigns or even attacks. While many governments have focused on developing legal frameworks to regulate AI, few have even recognized the existence of DAOs. Their looming exploitation for extremist and criminal purposes is something that has flown under the radar of global policymakers.\n\nTechnology expert Carl Miller, who has long warned of potential misuse of DAOs, told me that “even though DAOs behave like companies, they are not registered as legal entities.” There are only a few exceptions: The US states of Wyoming, Vermont, and Tennessee have passed laws to legally recognize DAOs. With no regulations in place to hold DAOs accountable for extremist or criminal activities, the big question for 2024 will be: How can we ensure the metaverse doesn’t give rise to digital white ethnostates or cyber caliphates?",

    "content": "In 2024, social media will get small.\n\nNot small in influence, of course. As the US weathers an election likely to be both divisive and often divorced from reality, social media will again be a battleground for public opinion and perception. But the platforms on which these conversations will take place will be smaller in scale, more diverse, and less connected to one another.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2016 election, Donald Trump discovered he could speak directly to an audience of tens of millions on Twitter. Thrown off the platform after the January 6 insurrection, Trump moved to the much smaller Truth Social, a network whose main selling point seemed to be his presence. Trump lost something precious when he was deplatformed: the ability to speak to the “big room”—a platform that reached a broad swath of the people interested in public affairs.\n\nBig-room spaces, like Twitter and Instagram, are continual battlegrounds for attention. They’re invaluable for activists, who want messages like #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter to reach new converts to the movement, and for influencers who build power and revenue by building audiences. But they are also inherently conflicted spaces, as people of different points of view spar over what types of speech are appropriate for the space.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nTrump is now speaking to a smaller room, but it’s one where virtually everyone who hears him agrees with him. He’s never going to be thrown off Truth Social, because his statements, no matter how inflammatory, are the raison d’être for the network.\n\nConsciously or not, other platforms are moving in the same direction. Elon Musk’s compulsive destruction of Twitter is turning it into a smaller room, a safe space for extremists that makes it unsafe for those who don’t share their views. Reddit, long one of the most exciting spaces for informed, topical conversations, is shedding users as it implements unpopular, Muskian policies in hopes of generating much-needed revenue. Some subreddits are migrating to Discord, where their conversations won’t overlap with thousands of other topics on Reddit, but where they have full control over their chosen rules of the road.\n\nSmall-room networks can be deeply important spaces for communities to find support and solidarity. When you seek support for living with diabetes or without alcohol (two struggles I’m personally engaged in), you’re not looking for confrontation, but for camaraderie, comfort, and constructive advice. Millions of us find these spaces in subreddits, Facebook groups, or even on special-purpose social networks, such as Archive of One’s Own, which links together 5 million fan-fiction authors and fans each month.\n\nBut small rooms have a big downside: They’re as useful for Nazis as they are for knitters. These conversations, insulated from outside scrutiny, can normalize extreme points of view and lead people deeper into dark topics they expressed a passing interest in.\n\nWe need small-room networks—they introduce strangers to one another, building social capital and connection between people who might never interact in the physical world. But they further fragment the public sphere, which means the 2024 election may be even more fractious than the ones we’ve seen thus far in our social media age.",

    "content": "Many years before ChatGPT was released, my research group, the University of Cambridge Social Decision-Making Laboratory, wondered whether it was possible to have neural networks generate misinformation. To achieve this, we trained ChatGPT’s predecessor, GPT-2, on examples of popular conspiracy theories and then asked it to generate fake news for us. It gave us thousands of misleading but plausible-sounding news stories. A few examples: “Certain Vaccines Are Loaded With Dangerous Chemicals and Toxins,” and “Government Officials Have Manipulated Stock Prices to Hide Scandals.” The question was, would anyone believe these claims?\n\nWe created the first psychometric tool to test this hypothesis, which we called the Misinformation Susceptibility Test (MIST). In collaboration with YouGov, we used the AI-generated headlines to test how susceptible Americans are to AI-generated fake news. The results were concerning: 41 percent of Americans incorrectly thought the vaccine headline was true, and 46 percent thought the government was manipulating the stock market. Another recent study, published in the journal Science, showed not only that GPT-3 produces more compelling disinformation than humans, but also that people cannot reliably distinguish between human and AI-generated misinformation.\n\nMy prediction for 2024 is that AI-generated misinformation will be coming to an election near you, and you likely won’t even realize it. In fact, you may have already been exposed to some examples. In May of 2023, a viral fake story about a bombing at the Pentagon was accompanied by an AI-generated image which showed a big cloud of smoke. This caused public uproar and even a dip in the stock market. Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis used fake images of Donald Trump hugging Anthony Fauci as part of his political campaign. By mixing real and AI-generated images, politicians can blur the lines between fact and fiction, and use AI to boost their political attacks.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nBefore the explosion of generative AI, cyber-propaganda firms around the world needed to write misleading messages themselves, and employ human troll factories to target people at-scale. With the assistance of AI, the process of generating misleading news headlines can be automated and weaponized with minimal human intervention. For example, micro-targeting—the practice of targeting people with messages based on digital trace data, such as their Facebook likes—was already a concern in past elections, despite its main obstacle being the need to generate hundreds of variants of the same message to see what works on a given group of people. What was once labor-intensive and expensive is now cheap and readily available with no barrier to entry. AI has effectively democratized the creation of disinformation: Anyone with access to a chatbot can now seed the model on a particular topic, whether it’s immigration, gun control, climate change, or LGBTQ+ issues, and generate dozens of highly convincing fake news stories in minutes. In fact, hundreds of AI-generated news sites are already popping up, propagating false stories and videos.\n\nTo test the impact of such AI-generated disinformation on people’s political preferences, researchers from the University of Amsterdam created a deepfake video of a politician offending his religious voter base. For example, in the video the politician joked: “As Christ would say, don’t crucify me for it.” The researchers found that religious Christian voters who watched the deepfake video had more negative attitudes toward the politician than those in the control group.\n\nIt is one thing to dupe people with AI-generated disinformation in experiments. It’s another to experiment with our democracy. In 2024, we will see more deepfakes, voice cloning, identity manipulation, and AI-produced fake news. Governments will seriously limit—if not ban—the use of AI in political campaigns. Because if they don’t, AI will undermine democratic elections.",

    "content": "A recent global study, which surveyed 10,000 young people from 10 countries, showed that nearly 60 percent of them were extremely worried about the future state of the planet. The report, which was published in the medical journal The Lancet, also showed that nearly half of the respondents said that such distress affected them daily, and three-quarters agreed with the statement that “the future is frightening.” This, and many other studies, show clearly that climate change is not just a threat to the environment that we inhabit. It also poses a very real threat to our emotional well-being.\n\nPsychologists have categorized these feelings of grief, distress, and worry about the current climate emergency—a common occurrence among youth today—under the label of “eco-anxiety.” According to the Climate Psychology Alliance, eco-anxiety is defined as the “heightened emotional, mental or somatic distress in response to dangerous changes in the climate system.” Eco-anxiety doesn’t just affect young people. It also affects researchers who work in climate and ecological science, burdened by the reality depicted by their findings, and it affects the most economically marginalized across the globe, who disproportionately bear the devastating impacts of climate breakdown.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nIn 2024, eco-anxiety will rise to become one of the leading causes of mental health problems. The reasons are obvious. Scientists estimate that the world is likely to breach safe levels of temperature rise above pre-industrial levels for the first time by 2027. In recent years, we’ve seen wildfires tear through Canada and Greece, and summer floods decimate regions in Pakistan that are home to nearly 33 million people. Studies have shown that those impacted by air pollution and rising temperatures are more likely to experience psychological distress.\n\nTo make matters worse, in the face of climate catastrophe, our political class is not offering strong leadership. The COP28 conference in Dubai will be headed by an oil and gas company executive. In the UK, the government is backtracking on its green commitments.\n\nFortunately, greater levels of eco-anxiety will also offer an avenue for tackling the climate crisis head-on. Caroline Hickman, a researcher on eco-anxiety from the University of Bath, cautions that the feelings of worry, grief, despair, and despondency associated with eco-anxiety should not be pathologized. After all, the cause of this mental distress is undeniably external. According to Hickman, anyone experiencing these emotions is displaying entirely natural and rational reactions to the climate crisis. Her suggestion? Harness eco-anxiety as a tool for good—as an emotion that can galvanize people to act in protection of our planet.\n\nThis is why, in 2024, we will also see more people around the world join the fight for climate justice and seek jobs that prioritize environmental sustainability. Campaigners will put increased pressure on fossil fuel industries and the governments that subsidize them to rapidly phase out the usage of polluting coal, oil, and gas. It’s now clear that not only are they the main culprits for the climate crisis, they are also responsible for the mental health crisis that is starting to affect most of us. Eco-anxiety is not something we will defeat with therapy—we will tackle it by taking action.",

It’s part of a generational redesign of work from being like a game of Tetris to becoming like a game of Roblox.\n\nGrowing up, I spent countless hours playing Tetris on my Nintendo Game Boy. There was something mesmerizing about slotting the flat-sided blocks together that fell from above. The design of the game was clean, precise, and simple. It gave the player a sense of order and control. I showed my 12-year-old son Tetris and asked if he wanted to play. “Why would I?” he quickly replied. “You can never beat the system.” And, in this sense, he’s right.\n\nOrganizations by design used to be a lot like a game of Tetris—top-down, hierarchal, with clear rules. Work had fixed boundaries around hours, physical locations, and roles. Importantly, these boundaries were mostly set by the employer, not the employee.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nWhile I’m part of Generation Tetris (or Gen X), my son is very much a member of Generation Roblox (Gen Z). In his world, just like in the game of Roblox, there are endless possibilities of realms you can create and roles you can play. You can invent your dream job, build bridges or spaceships, take care of a farm, or live in a mansion on the waterfront. At its heart, Roblox is about self-authorship. But the feeling of control comes from being a creator, not organizing blocks. He loves Roblox because, in his words, “It’s my world and my rules.”\n\nThe world of Tetris and the world of Roblox are in many ways a powerful metaphor for a profound power and trust shift happening in the world of work. Gen Z (and Y and Alpha that will start to enter the workforce at the end of this decade) have little interest in a way of working designed like a game of Tetris. The rules, rewards, and reporting structures don't make any sense to them. Given that, by 2025, 27 percent of the workforce in OECD countries will be Gen Z, it’s a pressing problem to fix. By 2030, the Roblox generation will be the majority, with over 58 percent of the workforce made up of Gen Z and millennials.\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, almost two-thirds of Gen Z would prefer to work for themselves or a startup. 80 percent of Gen Z workers globally are looking to find a job that better aligns with their values. About half report they would quit their job if it interfered with their work-life balance. The solution proposed to these changing work dynamics is often flexibility. Yes, younger generations want or expect more flexibility, but focusing on where and when people work is missing a deeper paradigm shift—people’s relationship to organizations has been transformed.\n\nIn many ways, the design of Tetris reflected a “power over” way of thinking about leadership: “If I tell others what to do, they will follow.” You don’t get to invent rules and boundaries; they’re inherent in a linear, top-down system. Roblox, on the other hand, represents a “power with” dynamic. There are no corporate ladders to climb or hierarchies to navigate—unless you invent them. Engagement comes from the game design being collaborative, autonomous, personalized, and peer-driven.\n\nAccording to a recent report by Gartner, employee engagement has 3.8 times as much influence on employee stress as work location. In other words, how people experience their everyday work—their feelings of involvement and enthusiasm—matters more in reducing stress than where they are doing their work. Gaming designers understand this, but most organizations don’t. In 2024, leaders will have no alternative but to accept that you can no longer play Tetris in a Roblox world.\n\nWIRED has teamed up with Jobbio to create WIRED Hired, a dedicated career marketplace for WIRED readers.

    "content": "In 2024, the maternal mortality rate (MMR) in the United States and the United Kingdom will grow, although postmortem reviews conclude that 80 percent of maternal deaths in high-income countries are preventable. Rates in high-income countries across Western Europe and Asia did decrease between 1990 and 2010, yet in some of these countries, like the UK, MMRs have risen over the past decade. The US MMR has been an outlier throughout, almost doubling in the first decades of the 21st century.\n\nReasons to support the prediction that MMRs will go up include the continuing consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, MMR increases in the US and UK predated Covid, suggesting the pandemic exacerbated deeper problems.\n\nNeglect and systematic bias in medical care systems is one of them. In the US, critical challenges to improvement include the lack of universal health insurance and the increasingly competitive health care system: The US has hemorrhaged maternity care providers to the point that 36 percent of US counties, mostly rural, have none. In the UK, health care is theoretically available to all, yet the NHS has suffered insufficient investment in its facilities and equipment. Half of NHS Maternity Units are now judged substandard; shortages of midwives have hit crisis proportions. Obstetricians and midwives in both countries are suffering burnout and choosing to strike, practice abroad, retire, or change profession.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nRacial and class inequity is entrenched. The highest MMRs and largest increases are in minoritized, working class, or deprived populations. Devastating as inadequate health care systems are for these groups, the fundamental causes of their health inequities are adverse living conditions, including the stigma and discrimination they face. Robust scientific evidence that the multiple systemic assaults with which they must contend in their daily round—material hardship, environmental toxicity, decaying municipal infrastructure, and structurally rooted psychosocial stressors—chronically activate their human physiological stress response.\n\nCombined, the stressors and the tenacious coping they entail cumulatively damage health down to the cellular level, in effect accelerating biological aging. Such erosion, called “weathering,” leaves the marginalized, maligned, or exploited to suffer multiple infectious and chronic diseases, functional limitations, and even death, long before they are chronologically old. In populations subject to the most severe weathering, the increasing trend of having children at older ages increases the risk of adverse maternal and infant outcomes. Maternal mortality is a barometer of weathering’s contribution to excess deaths, as the physical stress of pregnancy is harder to withstand for a weathered body, while other manifestations of weathering often become life-threatening only after the reproductive ages.\n\nIn 2024, weathering will keep being fueled by racism, classism, xenophobia, political polarization, resentment, white nationalism, and austerity budgeting. Brexit, one outgrowth of this resentment, now exacerbates UK labor shortages, supply-chain bottlenecks, inflation, and a reduced gross domestic product. Neither the US nor Western Europe fully embrace their minority or immigrant populations.\n\nIn 2024, this problem will intensify as wars and climate change increase the flow of immigrants of color. Despite the facts, the official stance of the UK Equalities Minister is dismissive of systemic racism as a cause of health inequality. The 2021 Report by the UK Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities turns to an unsubstantiated victim-blaming shibboleth, inferring that inequity stems from the failure of minoritized populations to exercise agency and take advantage of apparently abundant health-promoting opportunities. In the politically polarized US, active and influential populist movements seek to whitewash American history.\n\nIn 2024, countermovements to take racist and classist history seriously will continue to run up against strong undercurrents of political scapegoating and zero-sum thinking throughout both countries, increasing the severity and reach of weathering.",

    "content": "The platform is the canonical form of internet business: a two-sided market that facilitates connections between end-users and business customers. Uber connects drivers with riders; Amazon and eBay connect sellers with buyers; TikTok and YouTube connect performers with audiences; social media connects people with something to say with people who want to hear it.\n\nAnd yet, lax competition law has allowed companies to consolidate, cornering their markets. Consolidated sectors, meanwhile, find it easy to sing with one voice, blocking the passage of unfavorable regulation (there's still no US national privacy law) or its enforcement (the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation shows that Ireland is even more valuable as a lawless regulation haven than it ever was as a mere tax haven).\n\nUndisciplined by competition or regulation, platforms are free to slide into “enshittification,” in which the company extracts value from both sides of the two-sided market, relying on lock-in to keep users and business customers from defecting to a rival. The year 2023 was when the platforms soured: Twitch, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Google Search, and Discord all spiraled into terminal enshittification, transferring value from users to shareholders, leaving behind shambling half-dead things that were disagreeable, but un-quittable.\n\nThe secret to that un-quittability is high “switching costs”—the economists’ term for the things you have to give up to leave a service. You hate Facebook, but you love connecting with your communities, friends, and customers. They’re holding you hostage on Facebook’s behalf—and you’re holding them hostage, too. Facebook literally banks on these high switching costs: The US Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust case against Facebook revealed internal memos in which a product manager explicitly sets out to design features that “make switching costs very high for users” in order to make it “very tough for a user to switch” to a rival service.\n\nRegulators are increasingly alive to the fact that Big Tech deliberately designs its products to impose high costs on users who have the temerity to prefer their competitors. If a company fails to offer official means for users to take their data with them, or to continue to communicate with the contacts they leave behind when they change platforms, those users have little recourse. The once-common practice of reverse-engineering a rival platform to make an unofficial, interoperable bridge—say, a tool that scrapes your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other messages for a common inbox on a new, privacy-respecting service—have been effectively outlawed by anti-circumvention laws, patents, copyrights, and exotic contract theories like “tortious interference.”\n\nDespite these barriers to exit that keep users tethered to bad platforms, most of the regulatory response to Big Tech has been aimed at making it better, rather than making it easier to leave. We keep making rules obliging Big Tech to police disinformation, harassment, and a host of other evils, but with the passage of the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), we’re finally focusing on making Big Tech less important to its users, and thus less sticky.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nThe DMA lets the commission draft per-service rules to facilitate “interoperability”—connectivity—with new services. This isn’t mere data portability, or downloading a blob containing all the messages you've sent and the photos you uploaded. It’s the ability to leave a service, set up elsewhere, and resume the conversations and transactions you left behind. For example, under the DMA, it should be possible to leave Facebook and set up on a community-run Mastodon server, and continue to participate in group discussions and exchange individual messages with the people who aren’t ready to leave (yet).\n\nIn the UK, the long-overdue Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill finally gives enforcement powers to the Digital Markets Unit at the Competition and Markets Authority, which has dozens of smart engineers and policy people on HMG’s payroll, all champing at the bit to turn their detailed market studies into policy. If the bill passes, they'll have broad latitude to fashion remedies for each dominant service, including interoperability mandates obliging walled gardens to install gateways for new market entrants, making it easy for users to leave without isolating themselves from important social relationships.\n\nIn the US, multiple interoperability bills with broad bipartisan support have made it out of committee, only to be denied a vote after intense lobbying by the tech sector. But if the UK and EU impose interoperability on tech firms, it won’t matter whether America’s captured legislature can't manage to add its own—users all over the world will get the benefits of interop and its incineration of switching costs.\n\nThese remedies will start to come online in 2024. I believe we will see one or more of the Big Tech platforms facing a legal requirement to facilitate their users’ departure: “Mr. Zuckerberg, tear down that wall(ed garden).”",

    "content": "Every November, the Global Carbon Project publishes the year’s global CO 2 emissions. It’s never good news. At a time when the world needs to be reducing emissions, the numbers continue to climb. However, while emissions have been moving in the wrong direction, many of the underpinning economic forces that drive them have been going the right way. This could well be the year when these various forces push hard enough to finally tip the balance.\n\nIn 2022, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said it expected global energy emissions to hit their peak by 2025. This estimate marked a big change from the year before, sparked by accelerated investments in low-carbon technologies following the war in Ukraine. Rystad Energy—another research and analysis group—also expects a peak by 2025. Ember Climate—the leading source on global electricity data—estimates that emissions from global electricity already peaked in 2022. Analysts might disagree on the exact date, but it’s clear that a peak in emissions is now well within our grasp.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nThe world is already steadily decarbonizing its electricity. Solar and wind are growing quickly, and in 2024 these two sources of renewable energy could outstrip the increase in electricity demand. If this happens, coal- and gas-burning will go down, and so will emissions.\n\nUnsurprisingly, when we actually reach peak emissions will depend a lot on the world’s largest emitter, China. In 2023 its emissions were still rising. This is partly due to its continued recovery from Covid-19. An ongoing drought also means its hydropower output has dropped. These factors highlight, again, how difficult these things are to predict: One unexpected event can always flip a peak into another record-breaking year.\n\nChina’s peak, however, is going to come soon, because of record-high deployments of solar and wind, and an increase in nuclear power. Soon, the country will be adding enough sustainable energy to cover its growing electricity demand. China’s solar and wind output is already enough to cover the total electricity use of some of the world’s largest economies like Canada, Brazil, Russia, Japan, and even the world’s most populous country, India. In 2023 alone it could add enough to cover the UK’s entire electricity use.\n\nAnother reason why the peak in global emissions might arrive in 2024 is the electric car revolution. Global sales of petrol and diesel cars peaked half a decade ago, and the IEA estimated that almost one in five cars sold globally in 2023 were electric. Previously, the agency hadn’t expected this milestone to be reached until 2030. (In 2020, this figure was just 4 percent.) This move to EVs will start to eat into global oil demand, until its peak arrives too. According to a report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, this could be as early as 2027.\n\nOf course, peaking emissions is just the start. The world needs to then reduce emissions, and quickly. But the downslope will be easier than the turning point, as the energy transition will no longer be in its infancy. 2024 will hopefully mark the beginning of a mature low-carbon global economy.",

    "content": "Earlier this year, Parkinson’s disease (PD) research entered a new era when the Michael J. Fox Foundation announced a momentous scientific breakthrough—the discovery of a biomarker for PD. It meant that, for the first time ever, we can now pinpoint the earliest known signs of the disease in Parkinson’s patients.\n\nThis long-awaited new procedure is called the “alpha-synuclein seeding amplification assay” (SAA), and it’s capable of detecting the misfolded alpha-synuclein in spinal fluid—the wayward protein clearly linked to Parkinson’s. It separates, with a stunning 90 percent specificity, those who have evidence of PD pathology in their cells from those who do not. It does so even before the emergence of symptoms, much like the way high blood pressure or cholesterol levels are used to detect cardiovascular risk long before a heart attack lands someone in the ER.\n\nIt would be hard to overstate the implications of this development for people living with dysfunction in their alpha-synuclein. For one thing, we’ve never had a way to know who these people are—that is, until the moment of diagnosis, by which point ongoing damage to brain cells is already well underway. As for the diagnosis itself, which for most people comes as a bolt from the blue, it has always been frustratingly subjective and essentially based on a physician’s opinion following a brief once-over in the doctor’s office—not very useful for medical care provision, let alone biomedical drug development.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nThe new SAA test is already being integrated into drug trials as the first measure that can objectively identify people with the biology we’re targeting—offering drugmakers increased assurance that they are testing experimental treatments in the right populations. For biopharma firms weighing a decision to enter or stay in the high-risk neurological disease space, this changes the value proposition of investment on its face. In 2024, we will see a ramp-up of potential new drugs entering the pipeline and progressing along their path toward pharmacy shelves.\n\nWhat’s just as remarkable is how the SAA breakthrough was arrived at. The search for the biomarker required finding and studying “needles in a haystack”: people without any traditional symptoms of PD and unwittingly living with increased risk for the disease. It was critical to figure out what biology set them apart from those who don’t get Parkinson’s. But how do you find someone who doesn’t know they’re being looked for?\n\nAs it turns out, your sense of smell is a surprisingly good predictor of brain disease. (We’re talking here not about the short-term smell loss associated with Covid-19, but significant and enduring smell loss that persists over years.) For a while now, researchers have known about the link between smell loss and neurodegeneration, especially in the presence of certain other risk factors, such as a diagnosis with REM behavior disorder (RBD), a sleep disorder. Research shows that half of those over age 60 are living with some degree of smell loss, yet the majority don’t realize it until they’re tested. If you couple this with the fact that all major brain diseases—Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, ALS, Huntington’s—are associated with some amount of smell loss, this is astounding.\n\nThe Michael J. Fox Foundation’s large-scale observational study of Parkinson’s set out to use poor smell as one of its criteria for finding and enrolling at-risk individuals. (We should note that, for this risk group, it’s still unclear if or when the disease may eventually show up.) The highly sophisticated screening device used? A humble scratch-and-sniff test, albeit the scientifically validated variety.\n\nUntil the SAA biomarker was validated, a reduced sense of smell couldn’t be objectively linked to the presence of underlying Parkinson’s disease biology. But now we can report that the test accurately diagnosed disease in 99 percent of people with poor smell and so-called sporadic Parkinson’s (in other words, those with no genetic mutation).\n\nIn 2024, we will begin to see a sea change in the possibilities around screening for and predicting PD and, very possibly, other diseases of aging. An annual scratch-and-sniff test may soon become as commonplace as your mammogram or colonoscopy. In 2024, with widespread adoption, this simple, cheap, and accessible mechanism will radically alter the landscape of what’s possible in Parkinson’s research and care.",

    "content": "In 2024, I will walk into a physical space—a restaurant, a hairdresser, an arts venue, an artisanal cheese shop—and instead of being handed a physical piece of paper with some useful information on it, or being told it in words, I will be shown a faded roundel with a QR code on it. I will hold my phone’s camera up to it wearily. Sometimes it will work, but the font on the menu or the information will be small. I’ll have to enlarge it and take my glasses off to read it, because I’ve reached that age. Sometimes it won’t work at all. Sometimes the information on it will be out of date.\n\nIn all cases, many people—some elderly, others with access needs, children, anyone who just doesn’t fancy constantly looking at their phone—will be pushed toward more useless screen time and away from the kind of brief, friendly interactions with other humans that help us all feel part of the fabric of life. We’ll have reached the point of overdigitization.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nIt's not that there aren’t more gains to be made in technology. Incredible things are happening in biotech, especially since the pandemic. The world of continuous glucose monitors and lateral flow tests (LFT) will keep growing. In 2024 we will see new kinds of LFTs that test for other infections and problems. We will see more useful work in truly personalized medicine. But in the UK, at least, the benefit of those innovations will be increasingly available only for those who can pay for it themselves. The division between the technological haves and have-nots will only continue to grow.\n\nAnd although technology will continue to flourish, my guess is that the truly big gains in digital communication have now been made for a generation. If there’s innovation to come in digital communication it will be in the field of overdigitization, using screens where paper and actual words from real people both work better. We could—and should—use this next decade to shore up the gains we’ve made for all members of society. But I predict that, in 2024, we won’t. The Good Things Foundation estimates that 10 million people in the UK lack the basic digital skills needed to access the modern world. And 6.9 million people will continue to be excluded if they’re not given proactive help. But the current British government doesn’t seem much interested in raising the floor for the worst off.\n\nThese things can’t be done by individual companies, which come up with good-sounding ideas like, “why don’t we let people order a coffee while they’re getting their hair done, using a QR code!” It’s exactly the kind of things that incorrigibly urban WIRED readers like me think would be fun to use—but companies don’t tend to think about how to help people who aren’t going to spend money with them, or who are too put off by over-exuberant digital-everywhere to actually go into the shop.\n\nCompanies can look after their employees. And they can work to overcome that other half of the overdigitization problem: that many jobs are becoming more boring and isolated because they involve the equivalents of more pointing-at-QR-code-roundels and less actual interaction with people. But while companies can think about employees and about good customer service, thinking about improving equality and fairness is the job of government, not businesses.\n\nThere is of course one thing I can predict with total certainty for the UK in 2024: That the British public will get to have their own say on digital inequality and a whole host of other issues. Because, in 2024, Parliament will be dissolved in advance of an election.",

    "content": "“It might be the best time for any kind of business in any industry to raise money for all of history, like since the time of the ancient Egyptians,” an excitable Stuart Butterfield, CEO of Slack, told Farhad Manjoo in The New York Times in 2015.\n\nThis was no exaggeration. While interest rates remained close to zero, venture capital funds raised more money than ever and exited their investments at some of the highest valuations ever witnessed.\n\nThe glory days of VC are over, and if history is any guide, the tech bust should last through 2024 and beyond. In other words, the venture capital bust has only just started.\n\nUltralow interest rates benefited venture capital in a number of ways. Low yields on conventional investments lured investors to Silicon Valley, which promised outsized returns. Between 2016 and 2021, US venture capital investment tripled. Ultralow rates compress the dimension of time, making the future appear closer than it is. It's not surprising, therefore, that a large number of wildly extravagant startups got financed—luxury space travel, flying taxis, autonomous vehicles, and so forth. Due diligence took a back seat. Sam Bankman-Fried’s failed crypto-exchange, FTX, attracted a roster of blue-chip investors, led by Silicon Valley luminary Sequoia Capital.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nThe valuations of startups, whose profits lay in the distant future, were vastly inflated by easy money. After battery developer QuantumScape merged with a SPAC in 2020, its market cap exceeded General Motors’—even though the company expected no sales for many years. Easy money also fueled market liquidity, helping venture capitalists exit their investments. Never before were so many unprofitable companies floated at such high valuations. In 2021, more than a thousand IPOs came to the US markets, more than double the previous record.\n\nThe punch bowl was removed from the VC party after the Fed started to raise interest rates in 2022. QuantumScape’s stock is down more than 90 percent—but at least, unlike many other startups, it’s still in business. Bankman-Fried is in jail, awaiting trial. The IPO market has dried up. New entrants into the VC world have run for the hills. Others face large capital calls from VC funds they committed to during good times. Starved of fresh funds, many startups face a bleak future. WeWork, which grandly describes itself as an “office solutions company” (sounds better than “rentals”) and once sported a valuation of close to $50 billion, is the latest to hit the skids.\n\nThe Nasdaq index of technology stocks rebounded strongly in the first half of 2023. There’s huge excitement around artificial intelligence—NVIDIA, whose graphic processing units are used for AI, is valued at more than a trillion dollars. Great speculative bubbles, however, take years to unwind. Bear market rebounds, otherwise known as “sucker’s rallies,” are commonplace. After the dotcom bust, it took the Nasdaq a year and a half to trough (and more than 15 years to regain its peak). The IPO market saw little action for years.\n\nThe bear market in tech stocks is likely to return in 2024, with the Nasdaq index set to hit a new multiyear low. More startups will go bust, and venture capital funds will continue to post negative returns. As for Nvidia, it’s worth recalling what happened to Cisco Systems. During the dotcom bubble, Cisco, whose servers powered the internet, was briefly the world’s most valuable company. Its stock traded at nearly 40 times sales before crashing. More than two decades later, Cisco’s share price remains well below the bubble peak. Valued at around 35 times sales, Nvidia could well suffer a similar fate.",

    "content": "In 2024, we will see courts and regulators around the world demonstrate that tech exceptionalism, when it comes to the applicability of legal rules, is magical thinking. The tide has already started to turn on the assumption that law and regulation cannot keep up with technological innovation. But, in 2024, the sea change will come: not through new rules, but by old rules being applied aggressively to new problems.\n\nIn the United States, in the absence of federal privacy legislation, regulators have already started to repurpose laws and rules they do have at their disposal to address some of the most egregious examples of Big Tech playing fast and loose with our rights and personal data. In 2023, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) continued to expand the regulatory heft of consumer protection regulations.\n\nIt took on the problem of dark patterns—deceptive design used by apps and websites to trick users into doing something that they didn’t intend to, like buying or subscribing to something—with a half-billion-dollar fine against Fortnite maker Epic Games. The FTC also issued massive fines to Amazon for significant breaches of privacy through Alexa and Ring doorbell devices. There are no signs that, in 2024, the FTC will slow down, with rules in the pipeline to govern commercial surveillance and digital security. In 2024, we’ll see regulators in other fields and other parts of the world follow suit, bolstered by the FTC’s successes.\n\nIn 2022, the French Data Protection Authority, the CNIL, fined Clearview AI a record €20 million (around $21.9 million) for failure to comply with an earlier 2021 ruling, which had ordered the company to stop collecting and using data of persons on French territory. Further overdue penalties will be racking up in the millions of euros in 2023. In 2024, we will see regulators such as the CNIL taking more radical legal steps to show that no company is above the law.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nOpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, started 2023 with a call for global AI regulation, but balked at the actual prospect of EU regulation in the shape of the EU AI Act. While AI doomers asked for a pause on innovation to allow regulation to catch up, regulators including the Italian DPA found ways to clip their wings by stopping ChatGPT on their territory, albeit temporarily, with existing regulations. Ongoing intellectual property lawsuits, such as the one against Microsoft which charges the company to have illegally used code created by others, may well result in a turbulent 2024 for the fundamental business model of generative AI.\n\nIt is not only the individual impacts of technology that courts and regulators have in their sights. In 2024, they will also be considering the impacts on society, markets, and businesses. For instance, antitrust actions in the US and the EU launched in 2023 call into question Google’s dominance in the ad tech market, potentially shaking the monolithic logic of the programmatic advertising model that has helped create the internet as we know it today.\n\nIn 2024, we will see the regulatory void long enjoyed by Big Tech come to an end. While new laws and regulations like the AI Act, the Digital Services Act, and the Digital Markets Act in the EU start to take shape, courts and regulators will continue to apply existing law and regulation to the new ways that technology affects our daily lives. We will see the full panoply of legal tools coming to meet the challenges. Human rights and civil liberties law, competition law, consumer rights law, intellectual property, defamation, tort, employment law, and a plethora of other fields will be engaged to tackle the real-life harms already being caused by existing technology, including AI.",

    "content": "The ocean is Earth’s defining feature. Two of the most famous photographs of all time stamped that indelibly on our minds: Earthrise (1968) and The Blue Marble (1972), both taken during the Apollo missions to the moon. Once you have seen our fragile blue planet hanging in space, you can’t unsee it.\n\nThe ocean is an engine driven by sunlight, one that shifts and swirls as it carries energy, nutrients, and life around the planet in intricate patterns both large and small. The way it turns affects all our lives. It’s not a coincidence that Iceland happens to have rich fishing grounds, or that Britain is randomly warmer than Canada at the same latitude, or that luck of the draw means that the North Sea is green rather than blue.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nThese are all direct consequences of the way the ocean engine turns. Until now, the submerged workings of this giant machine have been hard to see and appreciate. In 2024, that will change.\n\nFor instance, the EU is currently building the first dynamic and interactive digital model of the entire ocean—a digital twin—which integrates knowledge from all branches of oceanography, including data from buoys, autonomous marine craft, satellites, and high-performance computational models. In 2024, this digital twin of the ocean will become operational. This will be publicly available to policymakers, businesses, and the public to help prioritize funds, make conservation decisions, and decide on how and where to deploy new marine infrastructure. The complex interactions of the ocean will become accessible in an entirely new way.\n\nOur attitude toward the ocean will also change. Historically, we’ve used it both as a universal rubbish dump (a place where we can supposedly discharge things without consequence) and as a universal resource (somewhere that is endlessly exploitable). Now that the damage this has done to the ocean is clear, we are starting to see ourselves as stewards of this engine and its life, both because it’s valuable and because we absolutely depend on it.\n\nIn 2024, a UN Global Plastics Treaty will be agreed upon, which will include a road map for controlling plastic use and waste, and a framework for reducing the plastic pollution that ends up in the ocean. Also in 2024, the second stage of an EU Action Plan for the oceans will kick in, forcing a change in rules for bottom fishing and fishing gear to specifically protect species such as common skate, guitarfish, great white shark, sturgeons, and turtles.\n\nMost importantly, our perception of ourselves will once again change. In 2024, the Artemis 2 mission will be the first crewed mission to return to the moon since 1972, taking humans around it, but not landing. For the first time since the Blue Marble photograph was taken, human eyes will once again be far enough away to see our blue planet in all its glory against the emptiness of space. And this time, when the photos are shared with the world, we will be able to see who we really are: citizens of a planet whose beating heart is its ocean.",

    "content": "In the decades to come, 2023 may be remembered as the year of generative AI hype, where ChatGPT became arguably the fastest-spreading new technology in human history and expectations of AI-powered riches became commonplace. The year 2024 will be the time for recalibrating expectations.\n\nOf course, generative AI is an impressive technology, and it provides tremendous opportunities for improving productivity in a number of tasks. But because the hype has gone so far ahead of reality, the setbacks of the technology in 2024 will be more memorable.\n\nMore and more evidence will emerge that generative AI and large language models provide false information and are prone to hallucination—where an AI simply makes stuff up, and gets it wrong. Hopes of a quick fix to the hallucination problem via supervised learning, where these models are taught to stay away from questionable sources or statements, will prove optimistic at best. Because the architecture of these models is based on predicting the next word or words in a sequence, it will prove exceedingly difficult to have the predictions be anchored to known truths.\n\nAnticipation that there will be exponential improvements in productivity across the economy, or the much-vaunted first steps towards “artificial general intelligence”, or AGI, will fare no better. The tune on productivity improvements will shift to blaming failures on faulty implementation of generative AI by businesses. We may start moving towards the (much more meaningful) conclusion that one needs to know which human tasks can be augmented by these models, and what types of additional training workers need to make this a reality.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nSome people will start recognizing that it was always a pipe dream to reach anything resembling complex human cognition on the basis of predicting words. Others will say that intelligence is just around the corner. Many more, I fear, will continue to talk of the “existential risks” of AI, missing what is going wrong, as well as the much more mundane (and consequential) risks that its uncontrolled rollout is posing for jobs, inequality, and democracy.\n\nWe will witness these costs more clearly in 2024. Generative AI will have been adopted by many companies, but it will prove to be just “so-so automation” of the type that displaces workers but fails to deliver huge productivity improvements.\n\nThe biggest use of ChatGPT and other large language models will be in social media and online search. Platforms will continue to monetize the information they collect via individualized digital ads, while competition for user attention will intensify. The amount of manipulation and misinformation online will grow. Generative AI will then increase the amount of time people spend using screens (and the inevitable mental health problems associated with it).\n\nThere will be more AI startups, and the open source model will gain some traction, but this will not be enough to halt the emergence of a duopoly in the industry, with Google and Microsoft/OpenAI dominating the field with their gargantuan models. Many more companies will be compelled to rely on these foundation models to develop their own apps. And because these models will continue to disappoint due to false information and hallucinations, many of these apps will also disappoint.\n\nCalls for antitrust and regulation will intensify. Antitrust action will go nowhere, because neither the courts nor policymakers will have the courage to attempt to break up the largest tech companies. There will be more stirrings in the regulation space. Nevertheless, meaningful regulation will not arrive in 2024, for the simple reason that the US government has fallen so far behind the technology that it needs some time to catch up—a shortcoming that will become more apparent in 2024, intensifying discussions around new laws and regulations, and even becoming more bipartisan.",

    "content": "Until now, AI systems have been largely designed to be algorithm-based and focused on input and output. But there is a conversation going on in both the digital technology and education sectors about the positive value of multidisciplinary design, and the importance of outcomes beyond revenue maximization and scaled efficiency.\n\nIn 2024, creativity will drive innovation in AI. Until now AI has curated things, but the release of new generative tools offers enormous opportunities for creators. Guided by creative technologists and leaders on both sides of the creative-tech divide, AI in 2024 will be thoughtful, more inclusive, and impact-led. Contrary to the belief that AI systems stifle creativity, this will catalyze inventiveness in corporations and academia. Here's what we can expect:\n\nThe Renaissance humanist and polymath Leonardo da Vinci is the poster child for multidisciplinary innovation: painter, draftsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor, and architect, his work spanned anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and paleontology. In today’s era of intelligence, the field of human-centered speculative design—which investigates the nexus between science, technology, and humans—will go through its own renaissance in the tech industry.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nSpeculative designers, creative technologists, and computational designers working with AI, hybrid, and mixed realities will be reshaping the very digital tools they have been using. They place less value on the product and more on the process and considerations around responsible and ethical AI.\n\nIn 2024, liberal arts universities will double down on programs which will, through research, new courses, and knowledge exchange, enable creatives to leverage code as a tool and AI as the material they shape. Core institutions include Stanford’s Human-Centered AI Lab and University of the Arts London’s Creative Computing Institute, established in 2020 at the intersection of creativity and computational technologies, where academics explore critical frameworks in decolonization, decarbonization, and issues of social justice.\n\nWe will see initiatives in creative and ethical technologies from Big Tech, and investment in sandboxes and incubators similar to the platform I founded, Open-Ended, looking at generative AI and large language models across the emerging technology spectrum.\n\nGoogle's creative tech-led AI team, Mural, is part of its machine learning research umbrella. Mural channels speculative design to consider how AI can benefit society and the planet to “question, provoke … and explore alternative imaginaries for AI,” and bring these back to Google’s core AI research. In 2024, Mural will partner with the University of Applied Arts in Vienna to engage AI with postindustrial and speculative design, led by lecturer Anab Jain.\n\nBy 2030, $134 billion will have been invested in immersive technologies, with a need for new content and ideas. We will see research-driven creative collaborations with robotics, gaming, and digital platforms. Artists who explore human and machine intelligence will propose a reconsideration of the formula-based concept of “intelligence” which is built into AI systems, to include creative intelligence, empathy, the intelligence of other species, as well as the wisdom of Indigenous cultures.\n\nSuch creatives are growing in number and influence. Polymathic choreographer Wayne McGregor is launching a project with Niantic in 2024 on the concept of “embodied physical intelligence.” Artists such as Es Devlin and Refik Anadol fuse art, science, and tech in interrogating and leveraging AI systems; they showcase their practice virtually and across the world, from the Museum of Modern Art to the World Economic Forum and UN General Assembly.\n\nIn 2024, how we design for AI will not be standalone. It will be woven into global issues: economic inequality, culture and creativity, geopolitics, the future of food, energy independence, and climate change. In the vein of the speculative design model, there is no need for clear “solutions”: There is a need for prioritizing creativity, humanity, and ecology.",

    "content": "In April 2022, when Dall-E, a text-to-image visio-linguistic model, was released, it purportedly attracted over a million users within the first three months. This was followed by ChatGPT, in January 2023, which apparently reached 100 million monthly active users just two months after launch. Both mark notable moments in the development of generative AI, which in turn has brought forth an explosion of AI-generated content into the web. The bad news is that, in 2024, this means we will also see an explosion of fabricated, nonsensical information, mis- and disinformation, and the exacerbation of social negative stereotypes encoded in these AI models.\n\nThe AI revolution wasn’t spurred by any recent theoretical breakthrough—indeed, most of the foundational work underlying artificial neural networks has been around for decades—but by the “availability” of massive data sets. Ideally, an AI model captures a given phenomena—be it human language, cognition, or the visual world—in a way that is representative of the real phenomena as closely as possible.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nFor example, for a large language model (LLM) to generate humanlike text, it is important the model is fed huge volumes of data that somehow represents human language, interaction, and communication. The belief is that the larger the data set, the better it captures human affairs, in all their inherent beauty, ugliness, and even cruelty. We are in an era that is marked by an obsession to scale up models, data sets, and GPUs. Current LLMs, for instance, have now entered an era of trillion-parameter machine-learning models, which means that they require billion-sized data sets. Where can we find it? On the web.\n\nThis web-sourced data is assumed to capture “ground truth” for human communication and interaction, a proxy from which language can be modeled on. Although various researchers have now shown that online data sets are often of poor quality, tend to exacerbate negative stereotypes, and contain problematic content such as racial slurs and hateful speech, often towards marginalized groups, this hasn’t stopped the big AI companies from using such data in the race to scale up.\n\nWith generative AI, this problem is about to get a lot worse. Rather than representing the social world from input data in an objective way, these models encode and amplify social stereotypes. Indeed, recent work shows that generative models encode and reproduce racist and discriminatory attitudes toward historically marginalized identities, cultures, and languages.\n\nIt is difficult, if not impossible—even with state-of-the-art detection tools—to know for sure how much text, image, audio, and video data is being generated currently and at what pace. Stanford University researchers Hans Hanley and Zakir Durumeric estimate a 68 percent increase in the number of synthetic articles posted to Reddit and a 131 percent increase in misinformation news articles between January 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023. Boomy, an online music generator company, claims to have generated 14.5 million songs (or 14 percent of recorded music) so far. In 2021, Nvidia predicted that, by 2030, there will be more synthetic data than real data in AI models. One thing is for sure: The web is being deluged by synthetically generated data.\n\nThe worrying thing is that these vast quantities of generative AI outputs will, in turn, be used as training material for future generative AI models. As a result, in 2024, a very significant part of the training material for generative models will be synthetic data produced from generative models. Soon, we will be trapped in a recursive loop where we will be training AI models using only synthetic data produced by AI models. Most of this will be contaminated with stereotypes that will continue to amplify historical and societal inequities. Unfortunately, this will also be the data that we will use to train generative models applied to high-stake sectors including medicine, therapy, education, and law. We have yet to grapple with the disastrous consequences of this. By 2024, the generative AI explosion of content that we find so fascinating now will instead become a massive toxic dump that will come back to bite us.",

    "content": "For researchers, social media has always represented greater access to data, more democratic involvement in knowledge production, and great transparency about social behavior. Getting a sense of what was happening—especially during political crises, major media events, or natural disasters—was as easy as looking around a platform like Twitter or Facebook. In 2024, however, that will no longer be possible.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download a copy of the magazine.\n\nIn 2024, we will face a grim digital dark age, as social media platforms transition away from the logic of Web 2.0 and toward one dictated by AI-generated content. Companies have rushed to incorporate large language models (LLMs) into online services, complete with hallucinations (inaccurate, unjustified responses) and mistakes, which have further fractured our trust in online information.\n\nAnother aspect of this new digital dark age comes from not being able to see what others are doing. Twitter once pulsed with publicly readable sentiment of its users. Social researchers loved Twitter data, relying on it because it provided a ready, reasonable approximation of how a significant slice of internet users behaved. However, Elon Musk has now priced researchers out of Twitter data after recently announcing that it was ending free access to the platform’s API. This made it difficult, if not impossible, to obtain data needed for research on topics such as public health, natural disaster response, political campaigning, and economic activity. It was a harsh reminder that the modern internet has never been free or democratic, but instead walled and controlled.\n\nCloser cooperation with platform companies is not the answer. X, for instance, has filed a suit against independent researchers who pointed out the rise in hate speech on the platform. Recently, it has also been revealed that researchers who used Facebook and Instagram’s data to study the platforms’ role in the US 2020 elections had been granted “independence by permission” by Meta. This means that the company chooses which projects to share its data with and, while the research may be independent, Meta also controls what types of questions are asked and who asks them.\n\nWith elections coming in the US, India, Mexico, Indonesia, the UK, and the EU in 2024, the stakes are high. Until now, online “observatories” have been independently monitoring social media platforms for evidence of manipulation, inauthentic behavior, and harmful content. However, changes in data access by social media platforms, as well as the explosion of generative AI misinformation, means that the tools that researchers and journalists developed in prior national elections for monitoring online activity won’t work. One of my own collaborations, AI4TRUST, is developing new tools for combating misinformation, but our endeavor is stalled because of these changes.\n\nWe need to clean up our online platforms. The Center for Countering Digital Hate, a research, advocacy, and policy organization working to stop the spread of online hate and disinformation, has called for the adoption of its STAR Framework (Safety by Design, Transparency, Accountability, and Responsibility). This would ensure that digital products and services are safe before they are launched; increase transparency around algorithms, rule enforcement, and advertising; and work to hold companies both accountable to democratic and independent bodies, and responsible for omissions and actions that lead to harm. The EU’s Digital Services Act is a step in the right direction of regulation, including provisions to ensure that independent researchers can monitor social network platforms. However, these provisions will take years to be actionable. The UK’s Online Safety Bill—slowly making its way through the policy process—could also help, but again, these provisions will take time to implement. Until then, the transition from social media to AI-mediated information means that, in 2024, a new digital dark age will likely begin.",

    "content": "Instead of going to the pharmacy to get the annual flu vaccine, many people in the US will now be able to get it shipped to their door to take at home themselves.\n\nStarting today, AstraZeneca’s FluMist is available through an online pharmacy in 34 states. FluMist is not a new vaccine. It was originally approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2003 and previously could only be administered by a health care professional. But last September, the FDA said the vaccine could be self-administered.\n\nIt’s AstraZeneca’s first foray into direct-to-consumer medicine—a trend being spearheaded by Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly to sell their popular GLP-1 drugs for diabetes and weight management to patients.\n\n“We recognized that people's daily lives are busier than ever, and we knew we needed to meet people where they are facing the realities of real life,” said Tonya Villafana, vice president of medical and scientific affairs at AstraZeneca, at a press conference on Thursday. “FluMist Home is designed to remove traditional obstacles to vaccination, things like scheduling clinic visits, waiting in line, and the fear of needles.”\n\nAstraZeneca is hoping that an at-home offering will help boost flu vaccination rates. Only about 47 percent of adults get vaccinated against flu, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Among children, flu vaccination rates are dropping along with those of other routine childhood vaccines. As of April 26 this year, 49.2 percent of children received a flu vaccination—lower than 53.4 percent at the same time the previous season, per the CDC.\n\n“Getting vaccinated each year is the best way to prevent influenza, which causes illness in a substantial proportion of the US population every year and may result in serious complications, including hospitalization and death,” said Peter Marks, former director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in a statement last year on FluMist’s approval for self-administration.\n\nThe CDC classified the 2024-2025 flu season as high severity across all age groups in the US, resulting in at least 610,000 hospitalizations and 27,000 deaths. It was the most severe flu season since the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.\n\nAstraZeneca’s September 2024 approval was based on a study with vaccine recipients and caregivers to evaluate whether the instructions for use were appropriately designed so that they could safely and effectively use the vaccine.\n\nThe vaccine contains a weakened form of the live influenza virus and protects against four types of flu strains. It is approved for ages 2 through 49. For those under 18, it must be administered by a caregiver.\n\nTo order, customers will need to complete a medical screening questionnaire. A licensed health care provider will review each submission to determine eligibility. Once eligibility is confirmed and insurance is verified, the vaccine will be prescribed and shipped directly to the purchaser’s home on a date they select. FluMist is covered by most insurance plans, but consumers will need to pay an $8.99 delivery fee.\n\nAstraZeneca says FluMist is not yet available in all states due to local pharmacy laws, but the company aims to be able to provide the at-home spray to all the contiguous states in the future. The vaccine will continue to be available in doctors’ offices and pharmacies for administration by health care professionals across the country.",

    "content": "This month, the US Department of Health and Human Services announced that it was canceling 22 contracts and investments worth nearly $500 million as a part of a “coordinated wind-down” of mRNA vaccine research. Yet some projects that do not involve mRNA or vaccines have been caught up in the purge. At the same time, the administration has quietly endorsed research into mRNA treatments for cancer and genetic disorders.\n\nHHS secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has long been suspicious of mRNA vaccines, and in May he announced that HHS would no longer recommend mRNA Covid-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women. The same month, he canceled a $590 million contract with Moderna, one of the mRNA Covid vaccine manufacturers, for a bird flu vaccine based on the same technology. In a video on social media, he justified the latest cuts by saying “HHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risk than benefits for these respiratory viruses,” which contradicts the scientific evidence.\n\n“The major misconception is that mRNA is some voodoo thing that we are sticking into our body, that it’s a magic molecule from Mars,” says Jonathan Kagan, an immunologist at Harvard Medical School and cofounder of Corner Therapeutics, which is developing mRNA treatments for cancer.\n\nShort for messenger RNA, mRNA is a molecule found naturally in every cell in the body. It provides instructions to cell machinery to make certain proteins and is used constantly by the body to run and repair itself. Kagan likens mRNA to an app for human health. Scientists have figured out how to make synthetic versions of the molecule that can be programmed to make different kinds of proteins. This tailored mRNA can then be delivered to people to address various diseases.\n\n“The problem with mRNA is that the first clinical application was the most political thing on the planet,” says Kagan, referring to the mRNA Covid vaccines. “Therefore the disease got muddied in the technology.”\n\nDeveloped and authorized during President Donald Trump’s first administration as part of Operation Warp Speed, the mRNA Covid vaccines use the molecule to direct cells to produce copies of the coronavirus spike protein, stimulating the immune system to create defenses against the virus. The shots were instrumental in reducing deaths and hospitalizations during the pandemic, and while they have a very high safety profile, they have been known to cause rare cases of heart inflammation in boys and young men. In June, the US Food and Drug Administration approved new labeling for Moderna’s and Pfizer’s mRNA Covid vaccines to emphasize this risk.\n\nResearch into mRNA vaccines had been ongoing for years, and during the pandemic the technology was used because it allowed for faster manufacturing compared to traditional vaccine development methods. The versatility of mRNA led to an explosion of interest in harnessing it against a range of other diseases, both in vaccines and therapeutics.\n\nAfter the success of the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines, the US government invested more heavily in mRNA technology. The canceled contracts announced on August 5 were part of a program under the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the agency within HHS tasked with developing medical countermeasures against pandemics and other public health threats. Among the projects canceled are some that weren’t working with mRNA or on vaccine development.",

    "content": "Astronomers have identified what could be a new supermassive black hole, and with an estimated mass 36 billion times that of the sun, it has about 10,000 times the mass of the black hole at the center of the Milky Way. This would make it among the most massive objects ever detected.\n\nThe finding, published in the Monthly Notice of the Royal Astronomical Society, was made by researchers from the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation at the University of Portsmouth in the UK in collaboration with the Federal University of Rio Grande in Brazil. The scientists located the signs of the new supermassive black hole within a gravitational lens known as the “Cosmic Horseshoe,” pictured below. A gravitational lens occurs when the gravity of a massive object, such as a galaxy, is so great that it bends light and time that passes near it, distorting light traveling from behind.\n\nThe Cosmic Horsehoe was discovered by the Hubble telescope in 2007. The galaxy LRG 3-757 sits at its center, while the blue horseshoe shape surrounding this yellow-colored object is distorted light emitted from another galaxy beyond it. LRG 3-757 is one of the most massive galaxies ever observed by astronomers, having a mass 100 times that of the Milky Way, and it sits approximately 5.6 billion light-years away from Earth.\n\nThe gravitational lens known as the Cosmic Horseshoe, so named because of the appearance of the incomplete ring of blue light that surrounds its central galaxy, LRG 3-757. Photograph: NASA/ESA\n\nThanks to this luminous structure, astronomers have been able to calculate the mass of the black hole that presumably lies at the center of LRG 3-757 (while not definitively proven, large galaxies are assumed to have a black hole at their center). Although there are no direct observations of this black hole, measurements of the motion of light in the ring and the velocity of stars in the inner regions of the galaxy are consistent with the presence of an ultramassive black hole. “By combining these two measurements we can be completely confident that the black hole is real,” Thomas Collett, professor of astrophysics at the University of Portsmouth, said in a press statement.\n\nCollett also suggests that a black hole of such proportions could only originate from the merger of two supermassive black holes resulting from the collision of galaxies. Astronomers are still debating whether this will be the shared fate of our galaxy, the Milky Way, and neighboring Andromeda.\n\nWhat About TON 618 and the Like?\n\nAny astronomy enthusiast knows that the most massive object found in the universe so far is potentially TON 618. According to the most widespread estimates, this black hole has a mass equivalent to 66 billion suns, almost twice that of the Cosmic Horseshoe.\n\nHowever, scientists are cautious about labelling TON 618 as the most massive object ever seen. Being located more than 10 billion light-years away, its host galaxy and surrounding objects cannot be observed in detail. What little is known about it comes from analysis of its brightness and from theoretical models that allow us to estimate its size. The uncertainty is too high to consider it the most massive black hole known.\n\nIn contrast, the Portsmouth researchers argue that the Cosmic Horseshoe black hole offers greater observational certainty, unlike distant, almost mythological holes like TON 618. As such, they claim that their discovery could represent the most massive black hole confirmed to date.\n\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED en Español and has been translated from Spanish.",

    "content": "A Powerade bottle from 2001 was found on Yaya, a Peruvian beach south of Lima. A Coca-Cola bottle from 2002 was found on Robinson Crusoe Island, a World Biosphere Reserve, in Chile. These were the oldest of all the bottles collected.\n\nThese discarded pieces of packaging were collected in a new macro-study that looked at the origin of plastic bottle pollution on beaches and cities along Latin America’s Pacific coastline. The research—the first to be conducted on a regional scale, thanks to a citizen science initiative covering 10 countries—combed more than 12,000 kilometers of coastline along the west coast of South and Central America. It found that across the region, Central American countries are most affected by coastal plastic pollution, and underscores the urgency of confronting this major problem.\n\nAlthough volunteers found numerous bottles dating back more than a decade, “most of them were less than a year old,” says scientist Ostin Garcés, an expert on the impact of plastic on marine ecosystems at the University of Barcelona and a lead author of this new research.\n\nPlastic makes up the majority of the garbage on coastlines around the world and has reached even the most inhospitable corners of the planet, including the deepest parts of the oceans and both the Arctic and Antarctic. Its impact not only has repercussions on biodiversity and the balance of ecosystems; various studies show how plastic already colonizes our insides, runs through our blood, and lives in our brains and organs. Microplastics have even been found in semen and ovaries. The microplastics that we eat, drink, and breathe every day are part of us.\n\nAn environmentalist searches for plastic waste and packaging dumped on El Esterón beach in Intipuca, El Salvador, in October 2024.

This study reveals surprising data, given that more than half of the bottles and caps collected had visible dates.",

    "content": "The Cleveland Clinic is partnering with San Francisco–based startup Piramidal to develop a large-scale AI model that will be used to monitor patients’ brain health in intensive care units.\n\nInstead of being trained on text, the system is based on electroencephalogram (EEG) data, which is collected via electrodes placed on the scalp and then read out by a computer in a series of wavy lines. EEG records the brain’s electrical activity, and changes in this activity can indicate a problem. In an ICU setting, doctors scan EEG data looking for evidence of seizures, altered consciousness, or a decline in brain function.\n\nCurrently, doctors rely on continuous EEG monitoring to detect abnormal brain activity in an ICU patient, but they can’t monitor every individual patient in real time. Instead, EEG reports are typically generated every 12 or 24 hours and then analyzed to determine whether a patient is experiencing a neurological issue. It can take two to four hours to manually review a day’s worth of brainwave data.\n\n“This type of thing is time-consuming. It is subjective, and it is experience- and expertise-dependent,” says Imad Najm, a neurologist and director of the Epilepsy Center at the Cleveland Clinic’s Neurological Institute.\n\nThe system that the Cleveland Clinic and Piramidal are developing is designed to interpret continuous streams of EEG data and flag abnormalities in seconds so that doctors can intervene sooner.\n\n“Our model plays that role of constantly monitoring patients in the ICU and letting the doctors know what’s happening with the patient and how their brain health is evolving in real time,” says Piramidal’s chief product officer Kris Pahuja.\n\nPahuja and CEO Dimitris Fotis Sakellariou founded Piramidal in 2023, with the goal of building a foundation model for the brain—an AI system that can read and interpret neural signals broadly across different people. Prior to this, Sakellariou spent 15 years as a neuroengineer and AI scientist doing EEG research. Pahuja worked on product strategy at Google and Spotify. Their startup, which is backed by Y Combinator, raised $6 million in seed funding last year.\n\nThe company built its ICU brain model using publicly available EEG datasets, as well as proprietary EEG data from the Cleveland Clinic and other partnerships. Sakellariou says the model incorporates nearly a million hours of EEG monitoring data from “dozens of thousands” of patients, both neurologically healthy and unhealthy. Brain activity patterns are extremely variable from person to person, so building a brain foundation model requires huge amounts of data to capture common patterns and features.\n\n“The beauty of a foundation model is the same way ChatGPT can generalize text, it can adapt to your tone, it can adapt to your way of writing—our model is able to adapt to the brains of different people,” Sakellariou says.\n\nCurrently, the Cleveland Clinic and Piramidal team is using retrospective patient data to fine-tune the model. In the next six to eight months, they plan to test the model in a tightly controlled ICU environment with live patient data and a limited number of beds and doctors. From there, they aim to slowly roll out the software to the entire ICU. Eventually, the software will allow the hospital system to monitor hundreds of patients at once, Najm says.",

    "content": "A new study by researchers at Northwestern University has set off alarm bells about the future of academic research, warning that the publication of fraudulent science is growing at a faster rate than that of legitimate research.\n\nOver the last four centuries, an implicit contract has been established between scientists and states: in exchange for producing knowledge useful for economic and social development, governments and other benefactors offer researchers stable careers, good salaries, and public recognition. This model, similar to that of a commercial enterprise, has proven to be efficient and has been replicated in most regions of the world.\n\nHowever, recent research published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) reveals that, in recent years, this system—composed of researchers, academic institutions, government agencies, private companies, and dissemination platforms—shows signs of breaking down.\n\nThe authors argue that due to the large scale and specialization of contemporary science, the contribution of each actor is no longer evaluated by the intrinsic merit of their work, but by quantitative indicators, such as the number of research papers published, how often articles are cited by other research, university rankings, or by awards and other recognitions obtained.\n\n“These indicators have rapidly become targets for measuring institutional and personal impact, which has generated unbridled competition and growing inequality in the distribution of resources, incentives, and rewards,” the authors warn.\n\nThis in turn has led to the proliferation of fraud in some quarters of the scientific community, as researchers look for quick ways to acquire indicators of success. “The use of numerical metrics to evaluate projects and professionals … encourages the search for shortcuts,” says Pere Puigdomènech, president of the Committee for Research Integrity in Catalonia (CIR-CAT) in Spain. The types of fraud detected range from the creation of fictitious research, to plagiarism, to the buying and selling of authorship and citations in papers.\n\nA Mafia That Threatens Scientific Integrity\n\nNorthwestern’s research shows that cases of fraud are often not isolated incidents, but rather the result of complex networks that operate systematically to undermine the integrity of science.\n\nThe research team behind this paper, led by Luis A. N. Amaral, professor of Engineering Science and Applied Mathematics at Northwestern’s McCormick School of Engineering, reached this conclusion after analyzing large volumes of data on retracted publications, editorial records, and image duplication.\n\nSources included major aggregators of scientific literature—such as Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed/MEDLINE, and OpenAlex—as well as lists of journals removed from these databases for violating quality or ethical standards. In addition, data on retracted articles flagged by the investigative website Retraction Watch, comments on the science-paper review site PubPeer, and editorial metadata (editor names and submission and acceptance dates) were also collected and analyzed.\n\nThis analysis highlighted the work of “papermills”—unscrupulous organizations that mass-produce low-quality manuscripts and sell these, sometimes through intermediaries, to academics looking to publish material quickly. These papers often contain falsified data, manipulated or copyright-infringed images, plagiarized content, and even absurd or physically impossible claims. “These networks are essentially criminal organizations, acting together to fake the process of science,” Amaral said in a statement published by Northwestern University.",

    "content": "The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.\n\nIn 360 BC, Plato envisioned the cosmos as an arrangement of five geometric shapes: flat-sided solids called polyhedra. These immediately became important objects of mathematical study. So it might be surprising that, millennia later, mysteries still surround even the simplest shape in Plato’s polyhedral universe: the tetrahedron, which has just four triangular faces.\n\nOne major open problem, for instance, asks how densely you can pack “regular” tetrahedra, which have identical faces. Another asks which kinds of tetrahedra can be sliced into pieces that can then be reassembled to form a cube.\n\nThe great mathematician John Conway was interested not only in how tetrahedra can be arranged or rearranged, but also in how they balance. In 1966, he and the mathematician Richard Guy asked whether it was possible to construct a tetrahedron made of a uniform material—with its weight evenly distributed—that can only sit on one of its faces. If you were to place such a “monostable” shape on any of its other faces, it would always flip to its stable side.\n\nA few years later, the duo answered their own question, showing that this uniform monostable tetrahedron wasn’t possible. But what if you were allowed to distribute its weight unevenly?\n\nAt first, it might seem obvious that this should work. “After all, this is how roly-poly toys work: Just put a heavy weight in the bottom,” said Dávid Papp of North Carolina State University. But “this only works with shapes that are smooth or round or both.” When it comes to polyhedra, with their sharp edges and flat faces, it’s not clear how to design something that will always flip to the same side.\n\nGábor Domokos discovers and builds new shapes to understand the world around us. Photograph: Ákos Stiller\n\nConway, for his part, thought that such tetrahedra should exist, as some mathematicians recall him saying. But he ended up focusing on the balancing acts of higher-dimensional, uniformly weighted tetrahedra. If he ever wrote up a proof of his off-the-cuff 3D conjecture, he never published it.\n\nAnd so for decades, mathematicians didn’t really think about the problem. Then along came Gábor Domokos, a mathematician at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics who had long been preoccupied with balancing problems. In 2006, he and one of his colleagues discovered a shape called the gömböc, which has the unusual property of being “mono-monostatic”—it balances on just two points (one stable, the other unstable, like the side of a coin), and no others. Try to balance it anywhere else, and it will roll over to stand on its stable point.\n\nBut like a roly-poly, the gömböc is round in places. Domokos wanted to know if a pointy polyhedron could have a similar property. And so Conway’s conjecture intrigued him. “How was it possible that there was an utterly simple statement about an utterly simple object, and yet the answer was far from immediate?” he said. “I knew that this was very likely a treasure.”",

    "content": "This story originally appeared on Inside Climate News and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nWhen staffing shortages caused the National Weather Service (NWS) to suspend weather balloon launches at its Kotzebue, Alaska, station earlier this year, a startup deploying next-generation weather balloons, WindBorne Systems, stepped up to fill the void.\n\nThe company began selling its western Alaskan atmospheric data to the NWS in February, plugging what could have been a critical data gap in weather forecasting.\n\nWeather balloons collect real-time atmospheric temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure data that meteorologists use to predict the weather and understand longer-term changes to the climate. The Alaska office was one of about a dozen to suspend or scale back balloon launches in response to deep staffing cuts instituted by the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Critics claim that the cuts have weakened the NWS’s forecasting capacity as hurricane season bears down and extreme weather events, like the floods that ripped through Texas, claim lives and destroy property.\n\nAs the beleaguered weather service struggles to maintain its forecasting and other services, it’s leaning on private companies to pick up the slack. For example, WindBorne, which is backed by Khosla Ventures, a venture capital firm focused on investing in companies with innovative business models and technologies, is opening five new balloon launch sites in the US this year as it expands its work with the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the parent agency of the NWS.\n\n“We’re flying more balloons every day and collecting more observations to help improve forecasts in light of some of these systems going down,” said John Dean, WindBorne’s cofounder and CEO.\n\nSofar Ocean, Tomorrow.io, Black Swift Technologies, and Saildrone are among other startups with innovative technologies and AI forecasting models that are increasingly supplying NOAA with critical atmospheric and oceanic data through its Mesonet Program. Such collaboration isn’t new, but former NOAA officials worry that the current administration, with its zeal for privatization, will jettison core federal observing systems and rely instead on private sector data to forecast the weather. While they lauded the companies’ innovations, they said that NOAA must maintain ownership of its “backbone” data assets like weather balloons to ensure public safety and maintain the historical climate record. New technologies, they said, should supplement NOAA’s core data collection efforts rather than replace them wholesale.\n\n“NOAA has always had a robust relationship with the private sector exactly for the sorts of things that WindBorne does,” like innovate and supply data, said Tom Di Liberto, a meteorologist and former NOAA spokesperson who is now media director at Climate Central. Under the current administration, however, “the concern is, what is it going to replace?”\n\nIf private services take the place of, rather than supplement, the agency’s core data assets, that could prove problematic, because “less data is bad,” he said. “Are we actually saving money or just giving taxpayer dollars to a private company?”\n\nData as a Service\n\nIn the past NOAA bought sensors and hardware from companies with promising innovations to bring the technology in house. More recently, it’s adopted a model of “data as a service,” in which it buys data from companies that maintain their own hardware and intellectual property rights.\n\n“While that can be fruitful for everyone, what I worry about is becoming so dependent on some of these innovative solutions,” said Rick Spinrad, who led NOAA during the Biden administration. “What happens when the founder [pivots]?”",

    "content": "NASA is fast-tracking a plan to build a nuclear reactor on the moon by 2030 under a new directive from the agency’s interim administrator Sean Duffy.\n\nThe plan revives a decades-old dream of scaling up nuclear power in space, a shift that would unlock futuristic possibilities and test legal and regulatory guidelines about the use of extraterrestrial resources and environments.\n\nDuffy, who also serves as President Donald Trump’s secretary of transportation, framed being first to put a reactor on the lunar surface as a must-win contest in a new moon race. “Since March 2024, China and Russia have announced on at least three occasions a joint effort to place a reactor on the Moon by the mid-2030s,” said Duffy in the directive, which is dated July 31.\n\n“The first country to do so could potentially declare a keep-out zone which would significantly inhibit the United States from establishing a planned Artemis presence if not there first,” he added, referring to NASA’s Artemis program, which aims to land humans on the moon in the coming years.\n\nThe directive laid out a roadmap to design, launch, and deploy an operational 100-kilowatt reactor to the lunar South Pole within five years that would be built with commercial partners (for comparison, 100-kilowatts could power about 80 American households). While the specs are, well, speculative at this point, 100 kilowatts represents a dramatic power boost compared to the basic nuclear generators that fuel Mars rovers and space probes, which typically operate on just a few hundred watts, equivalent to a toaster or a light bulb.\n\nThe implications would be transformative, “not just for the moon, but for the entire solar system,” says Bhavya Lal, who previously served as NASA’s associate administrator for technology, policy, and strategy and acting chief technologist. Placing a nuclear reactor on the moon would allow the space industry to “start designing space systems around what we want to do, not what small amounts of power allow us to do. It’s the same leap that occurred when Earth-based societies moved from candlelight to grid electricity.”\n\nCould NASA Build a Lunar Nuclear Reactor by 2030?\n\nEstablishing a nuclear plant on the moon by 2030 won’t be easy, but many experts believe it is within reach.\n\n“Four-and-a-bit years is a very racy timescale” but “the technology is there,” says Simon Middleburgh, a professor in nuclear materials and co-director of the Nuclear Futures Institute at Bangor University in the UK.\n\nThe issue up to this point hasn’t necessarily been technological readiness, but a lack of mission demand for off-Earth reactors or political incentives to strong-arm their completion. That calculus is now shifting.\n\n“We’ve been investing over 60 years and have spent tens of billions of dollars, and the last time we launched anything was 1965,” says Lal, referring to NASA’s SNAP-10A mission, which was the first nuclear reactor launched to space. “I think the big moment of change was last year, when NASA actually, for the first time in its history ever, selected nuclear power as the primary surface power generation technology for crewed missions to Mars.",

    "content": "An experimental pill made by Eli Lilly led to average weight loss of more than 12 percent of body weight in individuals with obesity, according to initial trial results announced by the drugmaker on Thursday. The pill is meant to be taken daily and would be an alternative to the company’s popular anti-obesity drug Zepbound, a once-weekly injectable drug.\n\nCalled orforglipron, it’s part of a growing class of drugs known as GLP-1s, which include Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy. The drugs mimic a naturally occurring hormone in the body that helps regulate blood sugar and promotes a feeling of fullness. Injected GLP-1 drugs have shown weight loss of around 15 to 20 percent.\n\nEli Lilly’s 18-month trial included more than 3,000 adults with an average starting weight of 228 pounds and a body mass index of 37, which is considered obese. Participants were randomized to receive either 6, 12, or 36 milligrams of orforglipron or a placebo pill. The lowest dose of orforglipron resulted in less than 8 percent loss of body weight, or about 18 pounds, and the middle dose led to a 9 percent reduction, or 21 pounds.\n\nThe highest dose led to the most weight loss—12 percent on average, or about 27 pounds, compared to 2 pounds with the placebo. In the highest-dose group, about 60 percent of participants lost at least 10 percent of their body weight, while 40 percent lost 15 percent or more.\n\nParticipants who received orforglipron started the study at a dose of 1 milligram daily and then increased the dose every four weeks to their final maintenance dose. Everyone in the trial, including those in the placebo group, was also prescribed a healthy diet and physical activity. There were no food or water restrictions for taking the pill.\n\nThe pill was safe, but like injected GLP-1 drugs, orforglipron caused gastrointestinal side effects for many participants. The most common was nausea, which was suffered by a third of participants in the highest-dose group; constipation was experienced by about a quarter of patients in that group, as were diarrhea and vomiting. Those side effects led to more than 20 percent of participants in each dosage group dropping out during the course of the study.\n\nEli Lilly says more detailed results will be presented in September at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes annual meeting and published in a peer-reviewed journal. Novo Nordisk has a GLP-1 pill for diabetes, Rybelsus, but it’s not as effective for weight loss as injectable versions and was never approved for weight management.\n\nOrforglipron also looks promising as a diabetes treatment. In a recent study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, the pill lowered blood sugar levels and weight in people with type 2 diabetes. Eli Lilly says it plans to submit orforglipron for regulatory review by the end of the year.\n\nNovo Nordisk has a GLP-1 pill for diabetes, Rybelsus, but it’s not as effective for weight loss as injectable versions and was never approved for weight management. A challenge with developing a more effective pill has been how to improve its bioavailability—the amount of drug that enters circulation and has an active effect. Other GLP-1 drugs are made up of larger molecules that are not easily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Instead, most of the drug gets digested. Eli Lilly might have solved that problem with orforglipron, a small-molecule formulation.",

    "content": "About five years from now, a modified Dragon spacecraft will begin to fire its Draco thrusters, pushing the International Space Station out of its orbit and sending the largest object humans have built in space inexorably to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nAnd then what?\n\nChina’s Tiangong Space Station will still be going strong. NASA, however, faces a serious risk of losing its foothold in low Earth orbit. Space agency leaders have long recognized this and nearly half a decade ago awarded about $500 million to four different companies to begin working on “commercial” space stations to fill the void.\n\nBut in that time there has been precious little metal cut, and there are serious concerns about whether any of these replacement stations will be ready to go when the International Space Station falls into the drink.\n\nOn Monday, in one of his first official tasks, NASA acting administrator Sean Duffy signed a new “directive” on commercial space stations that seeks to address this concern.\n\n“To meet the goals of a commercial system within the proposed budget, a modification to the current approach for LEO platforms is required as specified in the remaining sections of this directive,” states the document, signed by Duffy. To succeed, he wrote, the strategy “must be altered.”\n\nNASA’s previous plan involved issuing a “request for proposals” early next year as part of a competition that would have selected one or, at most, two companies to move forward into assembly and certification of their stations prior to flight. However, according to Duffy’s directive, there is up to a $4 billion shortfall in the budget NASA was expected to receive, and what would be needed for this program. The president’s budget request included $272.3 million in fiscal year 2026 and $2.1 billion over the next five years for the development and deployment of new commercial space stations.\n\nBecause of this plan’s perceived shortcomings, with the new directive, NASA is making some substantial changes to the Commercial Low Earth Orbit Destinations Program moving forward:\n\nInstead of moving forward in Phase 2 with a firm, fixed-price contract for certification and services, NASA will extend the current program of Space Act Agreements awarded to “multiple” participants.\n\nThere will be a “full and open” competition for interested companies to receive Space Act Agreements. NASA will award a minimum of two and preferably three providers within six months of the formal announcement of a proposal.\n\nNASA will shift the formal design, acceptance, and certification from this Space Act Agreement phase to a follow-on certification phase (so companies cannot get certified until after they fly).\n\nAt least 25 percent of milestone funding will be withheld until after a successful in-space crewed demonstration of a space station.\n\nThere is a new minimum capability NASA seeks, which is significantly less than the original “full operational capability” the agency sought. Now, the minimum required capability will be “4 crew for 1-month increments.”\n\nChanging the Program Completely\n\nSome of these are rather big changes. The ongoing reliance on Space Act Agreements, for example, will allow companies more leeway in how they design their stations. Had the agency moved into a more structured contract, known as Federal Acquisition Regulations, NASA could have levied more specific requirements on the companies.\n\nThis approach of lowering the minimum capabilities will also give companies a better chance to develop operational space stations by 2030, when the International Space Station is expected to be deorbited.",

    "content": "On August 10, six planets—Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—will line up in an arc in the night sky. Four of these planets—Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn—can be seen with the naked eye, while Uranus and Neptune will be visible through a very strong pair of skywatching binoculars or a backyard telescope.\n\nWhile August 10 marks the beginning of this planetary parade, these six planets will be visible until the final days of August, when Mercury sinks lower on the horizon and meanders too close to the sun to be observed safely. The next time that all of these planets will be visible together won’t be until February 2026, so you won’t want to miss this alignment.\n\nWhile this planetary parade starts on the 10th, the best date to view these planets is on the nights leading up to August 23, when there will be little to no moonlight and when Mercury will be at its furthest point from the sun.\n\nMoonlight and artificial light can wash out objects in the night sky, so you’ll want to do your skywatching under a clear, moonless sky and away from artificial light. If you must use a flashlight, opt for one with red light to preserve your night vision.\n\nWhat to Expect\n\nRising first are Neptune and Saturn, followed by Uranus, then Venus and Jupiter, and finally Mercury.\n\nOnce these planets are above the horizon on August 10, if you’re in the northern hemisphere, you will see Neptune and Saturn to the southwest (about 40 degrees above the horizon), followed by Uranus to the southeast (about 55 degrees above the horizon). Completing the arc in the east are Venus and Jupiter (both just over 20 degrees above the horizon) and lastly Mercury, which will just barely eke over the eastern horizon.\n\nIf you’re in the southern hemisphere, instead of looking south, you would look north to see these objects: Neptune and Saturn would be in the northwest, followed by Uranus in the north and slightly to the east. Venus, Jupiter, and Mercury would be slightly more to the northeast in the southern hemisphere, and they would be a few degrees lower on the horizon than in the northern hemisphere.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about each of these planets and how to find them.\n\nNeptune and Saturn\n\nFirst, Neptune and Saturn rise together between about 8:30 pm and 10 pm local time in many locations in both hemispheres. The exact times that the planets rise and set will vary depending on your exact location; you can use websites like Time and Date to find exact times.\n\nNeptune and Saturn will remain together until they set in midmorning. They will appear slightly to the west of the moon, under the constellation Pisces.\n\nSaturn is very bright and easily visible to the naked eye. You can spot Saturn’s marvellous rings with a pair of skywatching binoculars or a backyard telescope. Seeing Saturn’s rings for the first time is one of the most awe-inspiring moments you can have when stargazing.",

Now 29, she told the conference that she felt she had been “fighting illness” throughout her twenties. When she was 25, she needed abdominal surgery to remove a tumor which post-surgery tests showed was benign.\n\nWhen she found out about the operation, her grandmother, Emiko Yamanaka—now 91 and a direct survivor of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima—told her “I’m sorry, it’s my fault.” Kuwahara explained:\n\n“Ever since I was young, whenever I became seriously ill, my grandmother would repeatedly say: ‘I’m sorry.’ The atomic bombing didn’t end on that day, and the survivors—we hibakusha—continue to live within its shadow.”\n\nKazumi Kuwahara with her grandmother, Emiko Yamanaka, outside Hiroshima Peace Dome in 2025. Photograph: Kazumi Kuwahara, CC BY-NC-ND\n\nKuwahara came to stay with me 10 years ago during a study-abroad break after I had interviewed her grandmother for my doctoral research. When I’d made a film about Yamanaka in 2012, I immediately noticed her reluctance to share her harrowing experience. But she then invited me to interview her in Hiroshima—the first of 10 trips I made there for research that would become an interview archive.\n\nI wanted to research hibakusha like Kuwahara and her grandmother as they continue to confront the physical, social, and psychological effects of the atomic bombs dropped on August 6 and August 9, 1945, on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, respectively.\n\nThe 16-kiloton bomb dropped on Hiroshima at 8:15 am by a US B-29 bomber was codenamed “Little Boy” by the Americans. It exploded about 600 meters above the Shima Hospital in the downtown area of Nakajima—a mix of residential, commercial, sacred, and military sites. The bomb emitted a radioactive flash as well as a sonic boom. A gigantic fireball formed (about 3,000–4,000 degrees C), as well as mushroom cloud which climbed up to 16 kilomters in the air.",

    "content": "In 1938, Italian physicist Enrico Fermi, who had fled to New York to escape fascism, discovered a material in which a process of this type occurred: uranium. Fearing that the Nazis might also discover this element’s capability of producing a chain reaction, the Manhattan Project was born in 1940, a secret program for the development of nuclear weapons led by Arthur Compton. Compton formed a research group, which also included Fermi and Szilard, that would continue to conduct experiments on nuclear chain reactions. Theoretical physicist Julius Robert Oppenheimer was also part of the team.\n\nOn December 2, 1942, the first actual experiment took place beneath the University of Chicago football field; in a squash court, physicists built a reactor nicknamed “Chicago Pile 1” that achieved the first ever sustained nuclear reaction created by humans, providing confirmation of Szilard’s idea. In 1943, Oppenheimer became project manager at the Los Alamos laboratories in New Mexico, where the first true nuclear device in history would be designed and built. On July 16, 1945, the United States detonated it in the New Mexico desert. Twenty days later, on August 6, a similar bomb fell on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, and on August 9 on the city of Nagasaki, leading to the surrender of Japan several days later and the end of World War II.\n\nA Matter of Nuclei\n\nAs we all learn in school, atoms are composed of a nucleus of neutrons and protons, around which electrons orbit. Atomic nuclei can unite to form larger atoms, or fragment to form smaller atoms. The first case is called nuclear fusion, and it’s the process that occurs in stars, and which researchers today are trying to recreate in the lab as a means of producing energy. Under hellish heat and pressure, atoms fuse together to form heavier atoms. For example, in a star like the sun, hydrogen nuclei fuse to form helium nuclei. This process releases energy, which radiates out into the solar system, creating livable conditions on Earth.\n\nWhen a nucleus splits, however, we call it nuclear fission, which we exploit in a controlled manner in nuclear power plants and in a deliberately uncontrolled manner in nuclear bombs. In this case, heavier unstable atoms are fragmented into lighter atoms, a process that also releases energy. In addition to energy, excess neutrons are also released, triggering precisely the fission chain reaction conceived by Szilard. To sustain a chain reaction, however, the fissile material must reach criticality—a state where enough neutrons are being released and hitting other atoms to keep triggering further atoms to split. In a nuclear reactor, achieving criticality is the aim; in an atomic bomb, it needs to be surpassed, where one reaction triggers multiple further reactions and causes the process to escalate.\n\nFrom Fission to Fusion\n\nThose weapons discussed so far are “classic” atomic bombs, based on fission. Typically, an atomic bomb is triggered by a chemical explosion, which compresses a mass of uranium or plutonium until it surpasses criticality. Subsequent developments in this field of research, however, led to another type of nuclear device, called a fusion bomb. These are called thermonuclear bombs, in which a sequence of two explosions occurs. The primary explosion is equivalent to a fission bomb, with the aforementioned sequence of chemical explosion and fission chain. The energy released by the primary explosion then leads to a secondary explosion, used to trigger the fusion of hydrogen atoms. The most powerful device of this type ever designed and tested is the famous Tsar bomb, which was detonated in the Arctic in 1961 by the Soviet Union.\n\nHow the Explosion Occurs\n\nWe all have the image of a mushroom cloud in our minds. But how does it originate? As soon as an atomic bomb explodes, within the first second, there is a sudden release of energy in the form of free neutrons and gamma rays. The explosion appears as a fiery sphere that expands up to tens of kilometers from the trigger point. This fiery explosion, rising into the atmosphere, creates the typical mushroom shape. A thermal flash occurs; the heat emitted can start fires and cause burns even kilometers away from the center of the explosion (depending on the bomb’s power).\n\nExpanding so rapidly, the explosion creates a shock wave, a sudden change in atmospheric pressure that creates much of the destruction associated with atomic bombs. The peculiarity of atomic bombs, however, is the radioactive fallout: a shower of fission products that spreads over the area surrounding the explosion and which can contaminate it with radioactive elements for decades.\n\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED Italia and has been translated from Italian.",

    "content": "The US Coast Guard’s Marine Board of Investigation has issued a scathing report on the implosion of the Titan submersible in 2023, singling out OceanGate’s CEO and founder Stockton Rush for many of the company’s technical and managerial failings. It says that he made “sustained efforts to misrepresent the Titan as indestructible” and accuses the company of “glaring disparities between their written safety protocols and their actual practices.”\n\nJason Neubauer, who was the deputy chief of the Coast Guard’s Office of Investigations, chaired the investigation and tells WIRED: “All of the evidence pointed to a very singular leader in this operation. It all came back to Mr. Rush.”\n\nRush was piloting the Titan on a trip to the wreck of the Titanic in June 2023 when the submersible imploded, instantly killing all five crew. Also on board were Paul-Henri Nargeolet, a veteran submariner known as “Mr. Titanic,” and three paying passengers: entrepreneur Hamish Harding and a father and son pair, Shahzada and Suleman Dawood. The Titan had made 13 previous successful dives to the famous site.\n\nThe Coast Guard launched its investigation five days after the fatal incident and held two weeks of public hearings in September 2024. Technical testimony presented there detailed numerous flaws within the Titan’s innovative carbon-fiber hull, and highlighted operational failures on previous Titanic missions. These included one of the sub’s titanium domes falling off after the sub’s first attempt to reach the Titanic in 2021, and it being left outside in freezing conditions the winter before its final dives. Carbon-fiber composites can degrade if water freezes in small voids in the material.\n\nWitnesses also alleged that Rush had ignored or glossed over numerous safety concerns raised by others in the submersible community and even by OceanGate’s first director of marine operations, David Lochridge. Lochridge, who has not responded to inquiries, was fired in 2018 after detailing dozens of issues in an internal report. None of OceanGate’s current senior executives testified at the hearings, nor were those responsible for managing operations of the final dive called to testify at the hearings. The new report says Rush fostered a toxic workplace environment, using the looming threat of being fired to dissuade employees from expressing safety concerns.\n\nThe Titan was not registered or flagged with any nation, and had not been inspected or certified by any Coast Guard–recognized organization. The report found that Rush himself had lied about the submersible’s specifications when applying for his Coast Guard credentials, and the company had suggested several times that the Titan was or would be flagged in the Bahamas. “The most surprising aspect of the investigation is how far outside of compliance that the Titan was operating and for how long,” says Neubauer. “That fact stands out to me above any other incident I've ever investigated.”\n\nThe new Coast Guard report stops short of finding a definitive mechanical cause for the fatal implosion, which occurred almost instantaneously at around 3,000 meters depth. However, it says that the facts strongly suggest that it was either the failure of a glue joint between the Titan’s carbon-fiber hull and a titanium ring, or a delamination within the carbon fiber itself, where layers of the materials separated from each other. The company never properly analyzed or tested the hull to understand flaws during manufacture or how long it might last, according to the Coast Guard.",

    "content": "Quantum computing is interesting. It’s really a wonderful area for research, but my feeling is we have a long way to go. Today we have examples of quantum computers—hardware always arrives before software—but those examples are very primitive. With a digital computer, we think of doing a computation and getting an answer. The quantum computer is instead going to give us a probability distribution of where the answer is, and you’re going to make a number of, we’ll call it runs on the quantum computer, and it’ll give you a number of potential solutions to the problem, but it’s not going to give you the answer. So it’s going to be different.\n\nWith quantum computing, are we caught in a moment of hype?\n\nI think unfortunately it’s been oversold—there’s too much hype associated with quantum. The result of that typically is that people will get all excited about it, and then it doesn’t live up to any of the promises that were made, and then the excitement will collapse.\n\nWe’ve seen this before: AI has gone through that cycle and has recovered. And now today AI is a real thing. People use it, it’s productive, and it’s going to serve a purpose for all of us in a very substantial way. I think quantum has to go through that winter, where people will be discouraged by it, they’ll ignore it, and then there’ll be some bright people who figure out how to use it and how to make it so that it is more competitive with traditional things.\n\nThere are many issues that have to be worked out. Quantum computers are very easy to disturb. They’re going to have a lot of “faults”—they will break down because of the nature of how fragile the computation is. Until we can make things more resistant to those failures, it’s not going to do quite the job that we hope that it can do. I don’t think we’ll ever have a laptop that’s a quantum laptop. I may be wrong, but certainly I don’t think it’ll happen in my lifetime.\n\nQuantum computers also need quantum algorithms, and today we have very few algorithms that can effectively be run on a quantum computer. So quantum computing is at its infancy, and along with that the infrastructure that will use the quantum computer. So quantum algorithms, quantum software, the techniques that we have, all of those are very primitive.\n\nWhen can we expect—if ever—the transition from traditional to quantum systems?\n\nSo today we have many supercomputing centers around the world, and they have very powerful computers. Those are digital computers. Sometimes the digital computer gets augmented with something to enhance performance—an accelerator. Today those accelerators are GPUs, graphics processing units. The GPU does something very well, and it just does that thing well, it’s been architected to do that. In the old days, that was important for graphics; today we’re refactoring that so that we can use a GPU to satisfy some of the computational needs that we have.",

    "content": "There are more than a hundred ways to prepare a potato, and thousands of stories have begun with a shot of vodka distilled from this tuber. For centuries, the potato has been instrumental in feeding the world’s growing population. According to one study, the introduction of the potato from the Americas accounted for about a quarter of the population growth in the Old World between 1700 and 1900.\n\nNow, science reveals the vegetable’s surprising origins: It emerged 9 million years ago as a result of an unusual hybridization between an ancestor of the tomato and an ancient South American plant. This revelation rewrites the evolutionary history of one of the world’s most widely consumed foods and also explains how a simple tuber became a mainstay of the global diet.\n\nResearchers at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences conducted the most extensive genomic analysis to date on the domesticated potato. They studied cultivated varieties along with 44 wild species, conducting unprecedented genetic sequencing. The results revealed a stable mixture of genetic material between Solanum tuberosum (the traditional potato) and an ancestor of Solanum lycopersicum (the tomato).\n\nThe finding suggests that potatoes as we know them today arose from a process of hybridization between an ancient tomato plant and other Solanum-related species from the Etuberosum family that, until then, did not produce tubers. The results have been published in the journal Cell.\n\nBoth the potato and the tomato share a common ancestor that lived about 13 million years ago. Four million years later, their descendants successfully interbred. From this union emerged a new plant with the ability to form tubers: subway structures that store energy in the form of carbohydrates and allow reproduction without the need for seeds or pollination. This biological innovation facilitated the expansion of the first potatoes into regions with diverse climates, from warm to cold environments.\n\nThe study also identified revealing genetic details. The SP6A gene, considered the “switch” that determines whether a plant will develop tubers, comes from the tomato. On the other hand, the IT1 gene, which regulates the growth of the subway stems that form the edible tuber, comes from plants of the Etuberosum family, native to South America.\n\nBy considering the chronology of the hybridization and the geolocation of the species involved, the researchers proposed a hypothesis about the origin of the potato. During the Miocene, between 10 and 6 million years ago, the abrupt geological uplift of the Andes, driven by the collision of two tectonic plates, generated new cold climatic regions. Scientists believe this geological change forced plants to adapt to survive and expand, with two of them joining together to form Solanum tuberosum, which millions of years later would end up accompanying your hamburger in the form of French fries.\n\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED en Español and has been translated from Spanish.",

    "content": "Now, three mathematicians have finally provided such a result. Their work not only represents a major advance in Hilbert’s program, but also taps into questions about the irreversible nature of time.\n\n“It’s a beautiful work,” said Gregory Falkovich, a physicist at the Weizmann Institute of Science. “A tour de force.”\n\nUnder the Mesoscope\n\nConsider a gas whose particles are very spread out. There are many ways a physicist might model it.\n\nAt a microscopic level, the gas is composed of individual molecules that act like billiard balls, moving through space according to Isaac Newton’s 350-year-old laws of motion. This model of the gas’s behavior is called the hard-sphere particle system.\n\nNow zoom out a bit. At this new “mesoscopic” scale, your field of vision encompasses too many molecules to individually track. Instead, you’ll model the gas using an equation that the physicists James Clerk Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann developed in the late 19th century. Called the Boltzmann equation, it describes the likely behavior of the gas’s molecules, telling you how many particles you can expect to find at different locations moving at different speeds. This model of the gas lets physicists study how air moves at small scales—for instance, how it might flow around a space shuttle.\n\n“What mathematicians do to physicists is they wake us up.” Gregory Falkovich\n\nZoom out again, and you can no longer tell that the gas is made up of individual particles. It acts like one continuous substance. To model this macroscopic behavior—how dense the gas is and how fast it’s moving at any point in space—you’ll need yet another set of equations, called the Navier-Stokes equations.\n\nPhysicists view these three different models of the gas’s behavior as compatible; they’re simply different lenses for understanding the same thing. But mathematicians hoping to contribute to Hilbert’s sixth problem wanted to prove that rigorously. They needed to show that Newton’s model of individual particles gives rise to Boltzmann’s statistical description, and that Boltzmann’s equation in turn gives rise to the Navier-Stokes equations.\n\nMathematicians have had some success with the second step, proving that it’s possible to derive a macroscopic model of a gas from a mesoscopic one in various settings. But they couldn’t resolve the first step, leaving the chain of logic incomplete.\n\nNow that’s changed. In a series of papers, the mathematicians Yu Deng, Zaher Hani, and Xiao Ma proved the harder microscopic-to-mesoscopic step for a gas in one of these settings, completing the chain for the first time. The result and the techniques that made it possible are “paradigm-shifting,” said Yan Guo of Brown University.\n\nYu Deng usually studies the behavior of systems of waves. But by applying his expertise to the realm of particles, he has now resolved a major open problem in mathematical physics. Photograph: Courtesy of Yu Deng\n\nDeclaration of Independence\n\nBoltzmann could already show that Newton’s laws of motion give rise to his mesoscopic equation, so long as one crucial assumption holds true: that the particles in the gas move more or less independently of each other. That is, it must be very rare for a particular pair of molecules to collide with each other multiple times.\n\nBut Boltzmann could not definitively demonstrate that this assumption was true. “What he could not do, of course, is prove theorems about this,” said Sergio Simonella of Sapienza University in Rome. “There was no structure, there were no tools at the time.”\n\nThe physicist Ludwig Boltzmann studied the statistical properties of fluids. ullstein bild Dtl./Getty Images\n\nAfter all, there are infinitely many ways a collection of particles might collide and recollide. “You just get this huge explosion of possible directions that they can go,” Levermore said—making it a “nightmare” to actually prove that scenarios involving many recollisions are as rare as Boltzmann needed them to be.\n\nIn 1975, a mathematician named Oscar Lanford managed to prove this, but only for extremely short time periods. (The exact amount of time depends on the initial state of the gas, but it’s less than the blink of an eye, according to Simonella.) Then the proof broke down; before most of the particles got the chance to collide even once, Lanford could no longer guarantee that recollisions would remain a rare occurrence.",

    "content": "Peacock feathers are greatly admired for their bright iridescent colors, but it turns out they can also emit laser light when dyed multiple times, according to a paper published in the journal Scientific Reports. Per the authors, it's the first example of a biolaser cavity within the animal kingdom.\n\nAs previously reported, the bright iridescent colors in things like peacock feathers and butterfly wings don't come from any pigment molecules but from how they are structured. The scales of chitin (a polysaccharide common to insects) in butterfly wings, for example, are arranged like roof tiles. Essentially, they form a diffraction grating, except photonic crystals only produce certain colors, or wavelengths, of light, while a diffraction grating will produce the entire spectrum, much like a prism.\n\nIn the case of peacock feathers, it's the regular, periodic nanostructures of the barbules—fiber-like components composed of ordered melanin rods coated in keratin—that produce the iridescent colors. Different colors correspond to different spacing of the barbules.\n\nBoth are naturally occurring examples of what physicists call photonic crystals. Also known as photonic bandgap materials, photonic crystals are “tunable,” which means they are precisely ordered in such a way as to block certain wavelengths of light while letting others through. Alter the structure by changing the size of the tiles, and the crystals become sensitive to a different wavelength. (In fact, the rainbow weevil can control both the size of its scales and how much chitin is used to fine-tune those colors as needed.)\n\nEven better (from an applications standpoint), the perception of color doesn't depend on the viewing angle. And the scales are not just for aesthetics; they help shield the insect from the elements. There are several types of manmade photonic crystals, but gaining a better and more detailed understanding of how these structures grow in nature could help scientists design new materials with similar qualities, such as iridescent windows, self-cleaning surfaces for cars and buildings, or even waterproof textiles. Paper currency could incorporate encrypted iridescent patterns to foil counterfeiters.\n\nThere have been prior examples of random laser emissions in everything from stained bovine bones and blue coral skeletons to insect wings, parrot feathers, and human tissue, as well as salmon iridiphores. The authors of this most recent study were interested in whether they could produce similar laser emissions using peacock feathers and hopefully identify the specific mechanism.\n\nIt wasn't difficult to get the peacock feathers, given how popular they are for decorative and arts and crafts purposes, but the authors did make sure none of the feathers used in their experiments contained impurities (like dyes). They cut away any excess lengths of barbs and mounted the feathers on an absorptive substrate. They then infused the feathers with common dyes by pipetting the dye solution directly onto them and letting them dry. The feathers were stained multiple times in some cases. Then they pumped the samples with pulses of light and measured any resulting emissions.\n\nThe team observed laser emissions in two distinct wavelengths for all color regions of the feathers' eyespots, with the green color regions emitting the most intense laser light. However, they did not observe any laser emission from feathers that were only stained once, just in sample feathers that underwent multiple wetting and complete drying cycles. This is likely due to the better diffusion of both dye and solvent into the barbules, as well as a possible loosening of the fibrils in the keratin sheath.\n\nThe authors were unable to identify the precise microstructures responsible for the lasing; it does not appear to be due to the keratin-coated melatonin rods. Coauthor Nathan Dawson of Florida Polytechnic University suggested to Science that protein granules or similar small structures inside the feathers might function as a laser cavity. He and his colleague think that one day, their work could lead to the development of biocompatible lasers that could safely be embedded in the human body for sensing, imaging, and therapeutic purposes.\n\nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica.",

    "content": "This story originally appeared on Inside Climate News and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\n“We will drill, baby, drill,” President Donald Trump declared at his inauguration on January 20. Echoing the slogan that exemplified his energy policies during the campaign, he made his message clear: more oil and gas, lower prices, greater exports.\n\nSix months into Trump’s second term, his administration has little to show on that score. Output is ticking up, but slower than it did under the Biden administration. Pump prices for gasoline have bobbed around where they were in inauguration week. And exports of crude oil in the four months through April trailed those in the same period last year.\n\nThe White House is discovering, perhaps the hard way, that energy markets aren’t easily managed from the Oval Office—even as it moves to roll back regulations on the oil and gas sector, offers up more public lands for drilling at reduced royalty rates, and axes Biden-era incentives for wind and solar.\n\n“The industry is going to do what the industry is going to do,” said Jenny Rowland-Shea, director for public lands at the Center for American Progress, a progressive policy think tank.\n\nThat’s because the price of oil, the world’s most-traded commodity, is more responsive to global demand and supply dynamics than to domestic policy and posturing.\n\nThe market is flush with supplies at the moment, as the Saudi Arabia-led cartel of oil-producing nations known as OPEC+ allows more barrels to flow, while China, the world’s top oil consumer, curbs its consumption. Within the US, a boom in energy demand driven by rapid electrification and AI-serving data centers is boosting power costs for homes and businesses, yet fossil fuel producers are not rushing to ramp up drilling.\n\nThere is one key indicator of drilling levels that the industry has watched closely for more than 80 years: a weekly census of active oil and gas rigs published by Baker Hughes. When Trump came into office on Janunary 20, the US rig count was 580. Last week, the most recent figure, it was down to 542—hovering just above a four-year low reached earlier in the month.\n\nThe most glaring factor behind this stagnant rig count is the current level of crude oil prices. Take the US benchmark grade: West Texas Intermediate crude. Its prices were near $66 a barrel on July 28, after hitting a four-year low of $62 in May. The break-even level for drilling new wells is somewhere close to $60 per barrel, according to oil and gas experts.\n\nThat’s before you account for the fallout of elevated tariffs on steel and other imports for the many companies that get their pipes and drilling equipment from overseas, said Robert Rapier, editor-in-chief of Shale Magazine, who has two decades of experience as a chemical engineer.",

There's a growing group of people who long for the days of simpler devices with physical keyboards. A company is hoping to cash in on that by modding the BlackBerry Classic with Android and selling them online.\nA brand called Zinwa Technologies out of China is trying to bring back the old BlackBerry Classic Q20 with new components and the Android operating system in place of BB10. This was one of the last major phones launched by BlackBerry, back in 2014. So updated components are absolutely needed to get this thing running on Android.\nZinwa\nThe updated specs include a new main board, a more recent MediaTek Helio G99 chipset, 12GB of RAM, up to 256GB of onboard storage, a bigger 3,000 mAh battery, and new 50MP and 8MP cameras. For reference, the original Classic Q20 had a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Plus processor, only 2GB of RAM, a measly 16GB of storage, a 2,515 mAh battery, and 8MP and 2MP cameras. Oh, and the Micro-USB charging port has been replaced with USB Type-C. Here's how the changes look side-by-side.\nZinwa Q25 Pro\nBlackBerry Classic Q20\nMediaTek Helio G99 chipset\n12GB of RAM\nUp to 256GB of storage\n3,000 mAh battery\n50MP rear camera\n8MP front camera\nUSB-C charging\nQualcomm Snapdragon S4 Plus chipset\n2GB of RAM\n16GB of storage\n2,515 mAh battery\n8MP rear camera\n2MP front camera\nMicro-USB charging\nZinwa has two options for how you can get one of these devices into your hands. First, you can buy the full retrofitted \"\nZinwa Q25 Pro\n\" for $420. However, if you happen to have an old BlackBerry Classic Q20 already, or you'd like to buy a used one on your own, Zinwa is also selling a\nDIY kit\nwith all the components for $320.\nThe company is hoping to start shipping the first 100 orders by the end of this month. Mass production is being planned for mid-September. Of course, projects like these are notorious for missing deadlines, so take all of that with a grain of salt. Ultimately, the urgency will most likely depend on how much interest there is in this.

I've been on the hunt for useful free and open source apps, installing and testing them on my multiple Linux devices. Here are a few I found that are worth considering.\nAny given Linux distro has a seemingly endless selection of software in its repositories. It's all free to install, but it takes time and effort to dig up and dust off the hidden gems. The ones I pulled today I tried to keep varied enough there's something for everyone: the every-day desktop plant, the Linux gamer, or the command line warrior.\n3\nKMagnifier: Zoom That Doesn't Suck\nKMagnifier\n, often called KMag for short, is a magnifier app made by the KDE team. The premise is simple: use a small window to show a magnified version of whatever part of screen the mouse is hovering over. It can also simply zoom in or out of the screen as a whole, or specific windows, rather than using the mouse's guidance. It's meant as an accessibility tool, but there's a lot you can do with it other than just assist with sight disabilities.\nFor one, it's sort of a mini zooming screenshot tool. At any time with KMag in focus you can hit Ctrl+C and it will copy a PNG image of whatever's in KMag's window to your clipboard. You can then paste that in an image editor to save. You might find it a little more convenient than KDE's screenshot tool, especially if you're trying to capture small parts of the screen.\nInterestingly, KMag also has various color blindness simulators built in. If you activate one, it will show you how elements of the screen would look if you had that color blindness. That can be useful if you're a visual designer and you want to know how people with color blindness will see your work.\nA friend of mine also told me they use the KMag on a computer they keep in the far corner of the room. Sometimes they want to look at something on the small screen without getting up. They control it with a wireless mouse and keyboard, and with KMag activated, they can see details of the screen from far away. In that case, I'd recommend creating a keyboard shortcut that launches KMag so you don't have to look through an application menu first.\n2\nMoonlight: Don't Let the Sun Set on Your Games\nMoonlight\nis a set of software that lets you stream your desktop and specific games. Technically, you need to install two separate, uniquely named apps: Sunshine and Moonlight. You need one device, typically a PC, with Sunshine installed and running, making it the \"host\" server. On whatever device you want to stream to, there you install the actual \"Moonlight\" app, also known as a client app.\nWhat you get is the ability to\nstream games running on the host device to the client device\n. To use the analogy implied in the titles, Sunshine shines its rays, containing your games, across your network and Moonlight \"reflects\" those rays onto whatever device you want to game on. Clever, right?\nIf you're wondering why this would be that useful, let's say you have a powerful PC that's capable of playing AAA games. Due to space constraints or an office setup you need to maintain, the PC can't be moved from one room, but you want to play those games on your living room TV, your phone, tablet, or a laptop. Moonlight lets you keep everything in its place while gaming where you want.\nPersonally, I have Moonlight setup on a tiny HTPC connected to my living room TV so I can take advantage of my office PC's better hardware from my living room. No\n25-foot HDMI cable\nrequired.\n1\nTaskwarrior: To-Do in the Terminal\nTaskwarrior is essentially a to-do list that lives in your terminal. There's no full-on TUI (though some have attempted to develop one). Instead, you interact with your to-do list entirely by issuing commands. Your database of tasks is stored locally on your computer, and your tasks can be organized into projects and with tags, exported for reports, and set to be recurring.\nOnce especially nice thing about Taskwarrior is that, though it's terminal-based, it's friendly to fuzzy language. For example, if you want to remind yourself to take the trash to the curb this coming Thursday, you'd just use this command:\ntask add Take trash to the curb due:thursday\nTaskwarrior will record your task as being due on whatever date the next Thursday falls on.\nLet's also add a task to go get groceries, but instead of a fuzzy day in the future, we specify exactly what day on the calendar.\ntask add Get groceries due:2025-08-16\nNow you can see a list of all your outstanding tasks with the list command.\ntask list\nYou can see above that each task gets tracked with a numerical ID, the time that's passed since it was created, and the level of urgency. That's another interesting feature: Taskwarrior automatically estimates urgency based on the closeness of the due date, what priority level you assigned (if any), and other factors related to how you created the task.\nLet's say instead of reviewing every incomplete task, you only want to know what tasks are due tomorrow. It's as simple as calling the due:tomorrow filter.\ntask due:tomorrow list\nWhen you've completed a task, you use the done command. For example, if task assigned the id 1 is complete, you'd use this command:\ntask 1 done\nI've barely scratched the surface of what Taskwarrior is capable of. You can find the package in just about any Linux repository, typically with the name taskwarrior. Install it and start organizing your tasks like true command line warrior.\nLinux\nApps & Web Apps\nFollow\nFollowed\nLike\nShare\nFacebook\nX\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nFlipboard\nCopy link\nEmail\nReaders like you help support How-To Geek.

It’s actually easier than you think. While Adobe’s Lightroom app requires a paid subscription to edit RAW photos, Darktable is free and easy to install since modern Chromebooks easily run Linux apps.\nEnable Linux\nThe best way to edit RAW photos on Chromebook actually requires Linux. It’s pretty simple and straightforward to\nenable Linux on your Chromebook\n. This is because there's no native, offline-compatible RAW photo editors available on Chrome OS, so you'll have to install a photo editor designed for Linux instead.\nSimply go to Settings > About ChromeOS, then click \"Set Up\" next to the Linux development environment.\nThis will walk you through the process of configuring your Linux environment, including allocating storage to Linux (which can share storage with your ChromeOS environment for file storage).\nIf you plan to have a large image database with\nDarktable\n, I'd recommend expanding the standard 10GB of space to something closer to 20GB or 30GB to have room for the database to grow.\nInstall Darktable\nWhile the mobile\nAdobe Lightroom app\ndoes\nwork to edit RAW photos on your Chromebook, it requires a paid subscription to Adobe’s Creative Cloud to do so. Without a subscription, you’re limited to just editing non-RAW photos.\nAlso, there are quirks to editing offline using Lightroom on Chromebooks. The app has been known to sign users out of their account when offline, and sometimes it’ll launch the Play Store when you’re offline—especially if it can’t verify your subscription status.\nBecause Lightroom CC is so finicky for offline editing, I recommend diving into a different app to edit your RAW photos on your Chromebook: Darktable.\nPatrick Campanale / How-To Geek\nDarktable\nis an\nopen source RAW photo editor\navailable on all major desktop platforms—Linux included. If you've never heard of Darktable, that's okay. It's essentially an open-source alternative to the traditional\nAdobe Lightroom Classic\napp that runs on macOS and Windows.\nTo install Darktable on your Chromebook, you’ll want to use Flathub.\nSetting up Flathub\nis pretty simple, and once you have it ready to go, simply run the command\nflatpak install flathub org.darktable.Darktable\nin the Linux Terminal.\nThis will install Darktable through Linux on your Chromebook. You’ll be able to find the installed app through the Launcher and even pin it to your task bar.\nShare Your Photos Folder With Darktable\nOnce you have Darktable installed, go to your Files app, find the folder that has your RAW photos (whether that’s on your SSD or an external drive), and share it with Linux.\nTo do this, simply right-click on the folder and then hit \"Share with Linux.\" Typically, I just share my entire drive with Linux so that way I can always access the files on my Chromebook when using a Linux app.\nDarktable Brings Full RAW Photo Editing to Your Chromebook\nDarktable definitely has a learning curve to it—I’ve been editing RAW photos in Lightroom Classic for well over a decade, and it’s a bit cumbersome for me to use personally. However, Darktable is an immensely powerful photo editor, and it definitely rivals Lightroom Classic in its feature set.\nThere’s just about any editing tool you’d want to use in Darktable. There’s even a collection system similar to Lightroom.\nAll the editing that you do in Darktable is also non-destructive, happening in sidecar files that live next to each photo you edit. This means that you’ll never destroy the original image and all edits can be undone in Darktable, while the original RAW photos could even be moved to other software in the future should you want to do that.\nTim Brookes / How-To Geek\nDarktable truly converts your Chromebook into a mobile editing workstation. Something to keep in mind, however, is that Darktable might not run\ngreat\non all Chromebooks. The Chromebook Plus line requires devices to have at least an i3 processor and 8GB of RAM, but even that might not be optimal depending on the type of photos you’re editing.\nI used Darktable to edit some uncompressed RAW photos from my Sony A7iii, and it worked well. There was a little lag, but overall it was a decent experience. However, if I was shooting with a higher-megapixel camera like the A7Riv or even a Leica, then the Chromebook would likely lag a bit more.\nOverall, though, I was very happy with the experience that Darktable on my Chromebook offered me. In the instance that my Chromebook is the only system I have with me while out on a shoot, I can now confidently edit my pictures, which is pretty amazing.\nDarktable\nDarktable is a free, open source RAW photo editor available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.\nSee at Darktable\nExpand\nCollapse\nDarktable is just one of many\nLinux apps that work great on your Chromebook\n. I’ve used Linux to install Obsidian, GIMP, Discord, and even LibreOffice in the past. The addition of Linux a few years ago to ChromeOS really made Google’s budget-friendly laptops so much more powerful.\nChromebooks & ChromeOS\nPhotography\nChromebook\nFollow\nFollowed\nLike\nShare\nFacebook\nX\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nFlipboard\nCopy link\nEmail\nReaders like you help support How-To Geek.

The team has a lot of progress to show for it with Exchange support and handling user feedback on the Account Hub. Most importantly, the team is laying the groundwork for a major overhaul of the message database.\nAccording to the Thunderbird Monthly Development Digest, the team is close to completing its Exchange integration project. The testing process helped the developers find and fix many issues and edge cases in the current code, which should mean better and more reliable performance. The team has also added many features from the July roadmap, including automated test coverage, message filtering, marking messages as Junk or Not Junk, displaying and blocking remote content, modernizing and simplifying callbacks, handling certificate and connection errors, archiving, saving drafts, and managing back-off situations.\nThanks to all the progress the development team made, there are even more features from the project backlog being prioritized. This means even more features are likely coming in the next update. These include user experience improvements like undo and redo options for moving, copying, and deleting messages, as well as better status bar notifications to give users clearer and more helpful feedback.\nThe team is also working through the existing bug backlog to make a smoother transition when Exchange support is released to more users. Besides Exchange support, the team is also working on the recently introduced Account Hub feature. The team is working on the bugs that have been reported, but also on the feature itself.\nThe current focus is on fixing user-reported problems while also finalizing the Account Hub for Address Book items, particularly the often complicated setup of LDAP directories. The team plans to add telemetry to the Account Hub to see how users interact with it and find areas for improvement.\nThe Global Message Database (Panorama) project, which should change how Thunderbird manages and organizes email, is still a top priority. However, it sounds like recent work has mostly centered on Exchange support and larger code refactoring. The team is preparing for a dedicated work week focused on \"Conversation View.\" The upgrades to Conversation View should improve email threading and make performance with large conversations better.\nWhile August has been set aside as a maintenance-focused month, half the team is still working on \"inglorious yet important items\" from the development roadmap. Not every change can be groundbreaking—those under-the-hood fixes are important, too.\nBesides all the planned maintenance work to get ready for big updates, Thunderbird has made a lot of important fixes. That includes various fixes for newsgroup functionality, and port bugs to make sure Thunderbird stays compatible with updates to core libraries and operating system components. The team also worked on using standard colors throughout the application for a more consistent and visually appealing interface.\nThe next updates will be Thunderbird 142 and Thunderbird 140.2 ESR, which should arrive next week on August 19, 2025, according to the\nteam's release calendar\n.\nSource:\nThunderbird\nWeb\nEmail\nFollow\nFollowed\nLike\nShare\nFacebook\nX\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nFlipboard\nCopy link\nEmail\nReaders like you help support How-To Geek.

You might already know how to make text bold or italicized, or add a table, but there’s a less-common feature I’ve come to appreciate: reference links.\nYou’ve probably seen lists of references on Wikipedia articles, reference manuals, and other places. Markdown also gives you the option to create a reference list, and it’s a great way to clean up Markdown files that are using a lot of links.\nReferences vs. Inline Links\nThe most common links in Markdown are inline links, which require you to type the web address directly after the word or phrase that needs to be linked. For example, this creates a link to\nHow-To Geek\non the word “website”:\nCheck out\nthis\ncool [website](https:\n//howtogeek.com)!\nThese work well for occasional links, but they become messy and difficult to read in documents with many links, or documents using the same link multiple times. For example, a cover letter or resume could look like this:\nHello, I'm Bob McBobface. I worked at [Apple](https://apple.com) for\nfive years, before being hired at [Microsoft](https:\n//microsoft.com) as a\ndeveloper on [Visual Studio Code](https:\n//code.visualstudio.com). I also\nworked at [Red Hat](https:\n//www.redhat.com), [IBM](https://ibm.com), and\nthe [Fortnite](https:\n//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortnite) team at\n[Epic Games](https:\n//epicgames.com).\nThat’s difficult to read, especially if you’re using a text editor without syntax highlighting for Markdown. This is where a reference list can be useful, as it moves the links out of the way of the written text.\nHere’s the same example, but using reference links instead of inline links:\nHello, I'm Bob McBobface. I worked at [Apple][1] for five years, before\nbeing\nhired\nat\n[Microsoft]\n[2]\nas\na\ndeveloper\non\n[Visual Studio Code]\n[3]\n.\nI\nalso\nworked\nat\n[Red Hat]\n[4]\n,\n[IBM]\n[5]\n,\nand\nthe\n[Fortnite]\n[6]\nteam\nat\n[Epic Games]\n[7]\n.\n[\n1\n]: https:\n//apple.com\n[\n2\n]: https:\n//microsoft.com\n[\n3\n]: https:\n//code.visualstudio.com\n[\n4\n]: https:\n//www.redhat.com\n[\n5\n]: https:\n//ibm.com\n[\n6\n]: https:\n//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortnite\n[\n7\n]: https:\n//epicgames.com\nThe other main advantage to a reference list is that each reference can be used multiple times. For example, using the Red Hat link in another section of that document would just require typing\n[4]\nagain, instead of the entire web address.\nWith references, you can make your link-heavy Markdown documents much more readable, and Markdown parsers will still render them exactly the same as inline links. The list can be anywhere in your document.\nMore Features\nMarkdown has some additional options for references that can be helpful in some situations. First, you can use words in the place of numbers to identify references. Here’s an example:\nHi, I'm Bob McBobface. I was a guest star on [The Office][tv] before I\nworked\nat\nIBM\n.\nHave\nyou\nseen\n[that show]\n[tv]\n?\n[tv]: https:\n//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)\nThis is a great option for links that you’re using frequently, since it’s usually easier to remember a word or key phrase while working on a document than a number. Of course, if you make the ID too long in a document with many links, you’re back to the original problem of your document being difficult to read. I recommend keeping it to one or two words, or just sticking to numbers. Also, link names are not case-sensitive.\nMarkdown also supports implicit link shortcuts, so if you’re already typing the ID as the link text, you can have empty brackets for the link definition instead of repeating yourself. Here’s that example again, but with the shortcut:\nHi, I'm Bob McBobface. I was a guest star on [The Office][] before I\nworked\nat\nIBM\n.\nHave\nyou\nseen\n[that show]\n[The Office]\n?\n[The Office]: https:\n//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)\nFinally, you can add a title to each reference. This can be helpful if the URL or ID doesn’t explain anything about the web page, like a product page without the product name in the web address. Most Markdown HTML converters will also add it as the title attribute of the link tag.\nYou can use titles in references like this example:\nHi, I\n'm Bob McBobface. I just bought a [Galaxy S25 Edge][1] and it'\ns cool. I\nwas\nalso\na\nguest\nstar\non\n[The Office]\n[2]\n[\n1\n]: https:\n//www.mystore.com/dp/B0DYVMMM8C  \"Galaxy S25 Edge Product Page\"\n[\n2\n]: https:\n//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)  \"The Office on Wikipedia\"\nNow you know how to use references in Markdown. I have started using this feature more often in outlines and other documents that use repeat links, and it’s a lot better than copy and pasting the same links over and over again. Give it a try the next time your inline links are getting out of control.\nProgramming\nGitHub\nFollow\nFollowed\nLike\nShare\nFacebook\nX\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nFlipboard\nCopy link\nEmail\nReaders like you help support How-To Geek.

It simply pairs your Android phone and laptop, enabling various features and functions that happen between the two devices.\nSetup takes just a few minutes, so why not do it right now?\nWhat Is Phone Hub on Chromebook?\nWith Phone Hub on Chromebooks, you’re able to link your Android smartphone to your laptop over Bluetooth to access certain functions of your phone.\nFor instance, Instant Tethering will automatically connect your Chromebook to your phone’s hotspot if a known Wi-Fi network is unavailable. This makes working on-the-go easier as you don’t have to go into your phone’s settings, turn on the hotspot, then go back to your Chromebook, find the hotspot’s Wi-Fi, and then enter your hotspot password. Instead, it all happens automatically.\nPhone Hub will also allow you to see some notifications, reply to message notifications, and even ping your smartphone if you can’t find it. Another great use would be to transfer photos and screenshots from your phone’s gallery to your Chromebook wirelessly.\nPlus, Phone Hub (with compatible devices) can even stream apps from your Android smartphone to your Chromebook. This is different from a Chromebook’s ability to run Android apps natively, as it’s actually streaming the app from your phone—meaning it’s as if you picked your phone up to use the app.\nApp mirroring is different from installing Android apps on a Chromebook because not all apps support Chromebooks, and it also keeps you logged in as if you were on your phone. This makes it an ideal option for some social media platforms, some games that don’t support Chromebooks, and anything else you can think of.\nNot All Phones Support All Features\nWhile most Android devices are supported by Phone Hub, certain features are limited to select devices.\nMost notably, streaming apps to your Chromebook are limited to the following devices: Pixel 4a or later (running Android 13 or later), Nothing Phone (1) and (2), and the Xiaomi 12T, 12T Pro, 13T, and 13T Pro (also running Android 13 or later).\nJustin Duino / How-To Geek\nSadly, unless you have one of these devices, you won’t be able to stream apps from your Android phone to your Chromebook. Hopefully, Google opens this feature up to more devices in the future.\nHowever, if you want to dig a bit deeper into your Android system, you can simply\nuse ADB to wirelessly mirror the screen\nof any Android phone to your Chromebook. This does take a bit more command line know-how, since it doesn’t rely on Phone Hub to work, but it does open the door to mirroring any phone’s screen and bypassing Google’s limitations here.\nGoogle Pixel 4a\n10\n/\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10\nSee at google\nExpand\nCollapse\nHow to Pair Your Android Phone to Your Chromebook\nTo pair your Android device with your Chromebook, you’ll want to start by making sure your phone and Chromebook are on the same Wi-Fi network and that they are logged into the same primary Google account.\nNext, you’ll head to Settings > Connected Devices > Android phone. From this screen, you’ll want to click \"Set up.\"\nAfter you click the \"Set up\" button, a pop-up will come up that shows what device you’re connecting to. Verify the device name and model to make sure which of your phones (if you have multiple) you are connecting to. This screen will also show you what functions you’ll have access to through Phone Hub with your paired device.\nNow, click Connect and then enter your phone’s PIN code.\nOnce you're done setting things up, simply click \"Done\" in the lower right-hand corner, and you’ll be paired!\nHP Chromebook Plus x360 14b\n$379.99\n$659.99\nSave $280\nThe HP Chromebook x360 14b delivers an Intel i3-N305 8-core procesor, 8GB of LPDDR5 memory, and 128GB of UFS storage to pack a solid punch as a portable computer. Flanked by a 14-inch 1080p touchscreen and a 360-degree hinge, this Chromebook is ready for whatever you want to throw at it. You'll find two USB 3.1 5Gbps ports alongside one USB-A 3.1 5Gbps port on this Chromebook, plus a 3.5mm combination headphone/microphone jack. With over 10 hours of usage per charge, this Chromebook is ready to go all day with you.\n$379.99 at HP\n$399 at bhphotovideo\nExpand\nCollapse\nNow that you have your Chromebook and Android phone paired through Phone Hub, you’ll be able to use all the features available to you over a simple Bluetooth connection!\nHowever, your Chromebook isn’t the only device that your Android phone can pair to. Android phones and Windows 11 actually pair up pretty well, and\nthe process is similar\nto linking up your phone and Chromebook.\nBy pairing your Android phone to your Windows 11 computer, you’ll get notifications, messaging, photo copying, calls, and media controls.\nThere are other ways that you can pair your Android phone to your Windows computer, though, including\nusing services like Scrspy\nto mirror your phone’s screen to your computer(which works with about every modern Android device).\nAlso,\nWindows 11 supports an instant tethering feature\nsimilar to Chromebook if you set it up, making pairing your phone and computer even more useful.\nChromebooks & ChromeOS\nChromebook\nAndroid 13\nFollow\nFollowed\nLike\nShare\nFacebook\nX\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nFlipboard\nCopy link\nEmail\nReaders like you help support How-To Geek.

While the current administration dismantles many institutions, this one hits the hardest. PBS has been an institution for free news and entertainment for decades, showcasing the most educational and culturally enriching TV programming.\nI signed up for a monthly donation to my local PBS station to do my part. With my donation, I was granted access to the\nPBS streaming application, Passpor\nt, which showcases a vast library of streaming titles and live-streaming channels.\nAs a supporting member, I've rounded up this list of excellent PBS shows that make me appreciate everything that comes with public television.\n10\nNature\nRelease Year\n1982-Present\nSeasons\n43\nEpisodes\n653\nStatus\nOngoing\nNature\ncontinues to be the longest-running nature documentary series on PBS. The show covers wildlife worldwide, from the bison of Osage Prairie to the rhinos of Nepal. With stunning footage and insightful narration, the TV series explores our changing world for the behavior of animals and the shifting environments they occupy.\nWhile it might be hard to compete with the stellar documentaries from the UK (\nPlanet Earth\n,\nLife\n,\nNature World\n),\nNature\nremains strong because it focuses on being earnest and reflective of our world rather than filming pleasant and safe moments. The program doesn’t shy away from the effects of humans on the environment or the cruelty that comes with nature’s more violent and gross elements. With hundreds of episodes that are as engaging as they are informative, the show has been nominated for several Emmy Awards and won a Peabody Award.\n9\nThe French Chef with Julia Child\nRelease Year\n1963-1973\nSeasons\n8\nEpisodes\n212\nStatus\nEnded\nChef Julia Child forever changed how we look at cooking shows with\nThe French Chef\n. Her instructional program wasn’t about cooking common American meals, but dishes more familiar to a menu at a French restaurant. Even more impressive was how her episodes were filmed live, leaving room for plenty of relatable mistakes or, as Julia called them, “teachable moments.”\nAside from Julia’s inviting presence,\nThe French Chef\nis fun to watch for the inspiration it delivers in\ncooking up recipes\n. I don’t feel like watching a routine cooking program, but a master class for attempting the trickiest of meals. The devotion to charging forward makes her signature closing line of “bon appétit” not only deserved but fitting. Some old TV shows may have aged like milk, but\nThe French Chef\nis a fine wine, where Julia’s appreciation of butter and cream will never go out of style.\n8\nMs. Fisher's Modern Murder Mysteries\nRelease Year\n2019-2021\nSeasons\n2\nEpisodes\n12\nStatus\nEnded\nAs a spin-off series to\nMiss Fisher’s Murder Mysteries\n,\nModern Murder Mysteries\nshifts the Australian setting from the 1920s to the 1960s. Carrying on the sleuthing from Phryne Fisher is her long-lost niece, Peregrine (Geraldine Hakewill). Keeping the mystery-solving tradition alive, she works alongside Detective James Steed (Joel Jackson) to solve the many confounding murders that plague 1960s Melbourne.\nFor taking over a role once occupied by Essie Davis, Geraldine Hakewill makes her performance more of her own rather than trying to replicate what Davis has done, staking her claim as an assertive modern woman in a different decade. It’s also refreshing to have a murder mystery that is more alive with vibrancy than cozy vibes. So if the constant period-piece and small-town docile cases of the UK have gotten a bit stuffy,\nMs Fisher's Modern Murder Mysteries\nis a colorful divergence of a different kind of detective.\n7\nGrantchester\nRelease Year\n2014-Present\nSeasons\n9\nEpisodes\n59\nStatus\nOngoing\nBased on James Runcie's novels,\nGrantchester\nis a 1950s murder mystery series set in the titular village of Cambridgeshire. The local vicar of the town often becomes involved with murder cases that pop up in the community, aided by Detective Inspector Geordie Keating (Robson Green). The murders are pretty brutal, and the cases become more emotionally involving as the vicars balance their faith in the spiritual with their faith in the many suspects of the village.\nAs a part of the\nMasterpiece Mystery\nshowcase, Grantchester has become a stand-out series on PBS for its balance of the quaint and the dark. It’s not as cheerful as something like\nFather Brown\n, nor is it as stern as something like\nTouching Evil\n. There’s a solid amount of drama and a rotating series of main characters to keep the series going strong after over a decade of solving murders in a quaint 1950s UK setting, finding a good balance between the cozy and the compelling.\n6\nThe Joy of Painting\nRelease Year\n1983-1993\nSeasons\n32\nEpisodes\n416\nStatus\nEnded\nBob Ross was the painter who always came to mind for the most chill of art lessons. With his soft voice and bushy afro, his program,\nThe Joy of Painting\n, was a great way to either relax or get some tips on painting landscapes. The show would be a fairly quiet tutorial painting mountains and woods with occasional detours involving animals and family.\nBob Ross's iconography has spread so widely since his show ended that some younger viewers might not even be aware of\nThe Joy of Painting\n. With its chill atmosphere and charming hallmarks of Bob’s trademark “happy little bush” technique, watching his paintings come together has a satisfaction that has never been matched since. Considering that it’s common to find relaxed streams of artists creating an illustration in Photoshop or painting a model kit, Bob Ross’s show was ahead of its time and still holds up.\n5\nDoc Martin\nRelease Year\n2004-2022\nSeasons\n10\nEpisodes\n79\nStatus\nEnded\nSet in the picturesque fishing village of Portwenn,\nDoc Martin\nfollows the medical adventures of the cantankerous Doctor Martin Ellingham (Martin Clunes). Having been used to the luxuries of London, moving to a practice in a smaller town has made him irritable. Still, he does his best to provide the medical care he can for the most challenging cases and even falls in love with the local teacher, Louisa (Caroline Catz).\nDoc Martin\nhas a lot of charm, from his gorgeous location in the mountains overlooking the ocean to his rocky chemistry with his community and patients. His bedside manner is atrocious, but his ability to sniff out medical complications and sabotage makes him an invaluable asset to Portwenn. His romantic developments with Louisa also make the show worth returning to, if only to see where their love will take them next.\n4\nFrontline\nRelease Year\n1983-Present\nSeasons\n43\nEpisodes\n827\nStatus\nOngoing\nWhile\nPBS NewsHour\nis a fine show for keeping up with current events,\nFrontline\nremains the more in-depth show about what is happening today. The long-running educational program, based out of Boston’s GBH station, covers everything from politics to terrorism to war abroad and at home. Where NewsHour ends,\nFrontline\nexpands with longer interviews, more history, and greater context to get the full story.\nFrontline\ndoesn’t pull its punches when tackling the harder issues, charging ahead on issues of Putin’s war on the press, Musk’s takeover of Twitter, and Trump’s subversion of the law. The show does, however, cover environmental issues regarding native villages of Alaska threatened by climate change and the devastation of Hurricane Helene. But the best reason to watch is for the showcase of award-winning documentary movies like\nAntidote\nand\n20 Days in Mariupol\n.\n3\nMidsomer Murders\nRelease Year\n1997-Present\nSeasons\n24\nEpisodes\n140\nStatus\nOngoing\nBased on Caroline Graham's novels about Chief Inspector Barnaby,\nMidsomer Murders\nfollows the investigations of murders within the fictional English county of Midsomer. Local detectives track down leads to find the culprits, engaging with all the quirky characters of the community. Through it all, the detective manages to not only find some levity but even some dark humor in the decades of murders, such as a woman being killed with cheese or an assassination from a dollhouse window.\nMidsomer Murders\nis one of the more enduring mystery shows, considering how much it embraces humor beyond the usual tongue-in-cheek or wry scathings in between murders of the week. The performances are also rather stellar, and the soundtrack is fitting, with a theme embracing the weirdness of a theremin. Even after 24 seasons, there’s still a comfort to be had tuning in on Saturday nights for these odd mysteries, making it clear why the show has been on for so long and resonated enough to be popular in over 200 countries.\n2\nNOVA\nRelease Year\n1974-Present\nSeasons\n52\nEpisodes\n999\nStatus\nOngoing\nNOVA\nmade science come alive with the most updated and exciting developments, from advancements in airport engineering to the next innovative space telescope. The award-winning series is packed with insight into the many interviews with scientists, but also boasts plenty of remarkable footage of technological developments and moments of discovery. The topics can also be historical or current, spanning from Egyptian tombs' secrets to the Baltimore bridge's recent collapse.\nFor being on the air for 52 seasons, you’ve likely seen\nNOVA\nused in one of your science classrooms. These episodes were always a highlight because of their entertaining format and neat opening, which has only grown more exciting with the new openings. The show is also essential for covering the more crucial scientific aspects of the AIDS epidemic, climate change, and the COVID-19 pandemic, providing key facts when we need them most.\n1\nAgatha Christie's Poirot\nRelease Year\n1989-2013\nSeasons\n13\nEpisodes\n70\nStatus\nEnded\nThere have been plenty of adaptations of Agatha Christie’s quirky Belgian detective, but it’s hard to beat David Suchet’s portrayal in\nPoirot\n. With his allies Captain Arthur Hastings and Chief Inspector James Japp, the usually reserved Hercule Poirot will come out of his shell just enough to solve a case in his many adventures. He’ll use his little gray cells to solve mysterious deaths everywhere, from trains to Halloween parties.\nSuchet’s performance holds up so well that returning to this series for that pitch-perfect performance is fun. Comparing his role in the story of\nMurder on the Orient Express\nto an older portrayal by Albert Finney and the recent one by Kenneth Branagh offers no contest. David Suchet owns the role of Poirot, making it all the more satisfying that he played the character for 70 glorious episodes of cozy mystery comfort.\nIt’s easy to take PBS for granted when so many more tantalizing TV networks and streaming services are available. But with such a variety of acclaimed documentaries, murder mysteries, and instructional programs, there’s a little bit of everything to stimulate the minds of the intellectually curious. Whether you want to stay updated on the world or retreat to a cozy classic, PBS is worth supporting for all it offers.\nPBS\nPBS is America's free public broadcast institution that delivers trusted news, inspiring stories, and award-winning shows, available to stream through PBS Passport.\nVisit PBS\nExpand\nCollapse\nStreaming\nFollow\nFollowed\nLike\nShare\nFacebook\nX\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nFlipboard\nCopy link\nEmail\nReaders like you help support How-To Geek.

Gamified learning apps are a great way to begin the journey. Instead of spending hours slogging through documentation or videos, you can learn the core concepts of Python programming while playing games.\nEach of the platforms here take a different approach to gamification, but each one works to grow your Python skills while keeping you engaged. What makes\nthe gamification approach\nso effective is how it uses the same mechanics and behaviors that keep you hooked on a good game. Points and levels help you see your progress, while interactive challenges make sure you’re actually applying what you learn, not just memorizing it. You’re building muscle memory through action, not rote learning. And because every “win” is tied to solving a real coding problem, you walk away with skills that last long after the game is over.\nPython is great for those new to programming\n. It’s written in clear syntax that is understandable, making it easier to learn, especially for those without a developer background.\n3\nEarSketch\nAs a musician,\nEarSketch\nreally hooked me in. I can’t think of another place where I can learn programming and create music at the same time. The program is a browser-based digital audio workstation (DAW) where your instrument becomes Python (or JavaScript). Type in a few lines of code and you’ll be creating music in no time.\nWhat I really like about EarSketch is how it blends creativity with coding in a way that feels natural. Loops aren’t a programming concept, they’re your drum loops. Methods become a way to build melodies. Instead of practicing Python by printing “Hello, World,” you’re creating something you actually want to listen to, and that makes it far easier to stay motivated.\n2\nCodeWars\nThe first time I logged into\nCodeWars\n, I wasn’t greeted with a long lecture or a wall of text. I was dropped straight into a challenge. No warm-up, no handholding, just a problem to solve and a blinking cursor daring me to start. The platform provides a place to practice and improve your coding skills through gamified challenges called “Kata”. Each Kata feels like a small puzzle you need to solve. It goes well beyond just Python too. The app covers more than 50 different programming languages, so if Python isn’t your thing, there are many other programming languages you could learn.\nWhat I like most about this app is the variety. Some challenges are short and sweet, while others stretch your mind, making you think in new ways. And, when you finish, you can see how other people solved it. Sometimes their approach is cleaner, sometimes more creative, but almost always different from yours. That constant exposure to alternative ways of thinking is addictive. It turns every session into a mix of problem-solving, skill-building, and a bit of friendly competition. CodeWars doesn’t just teach you Python; it sharpens your thinking in ways that are both rewarding and challenging.\n1\nMimo\nMimo\nis a mobile-first app that teaches Python along with several other programming languages.\nHTML\nCSS\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nSwift\nReact\nSQL\nNode.js\nExpress.js\nI like Mimo because in many ways it’s bite-sized. I’ve used it between meetings, while sitting in my car, or while waiting for my wife to get ready, and it turns those moments into micro-learning experiences. The app guides you step-by-step, and when you run into something you don’t understand or remember, it gives some context to help keep your forward momentum.\nMimo does an excellent job of making your consistency feel rewarding. Streaks, reminders, and a progress dashboard get me to log in every day. The lessons are short and interactive. Breaking Python into bite-sized tasks builds momentum fast, and before you realize it, you’ve created something with structure. Watching your dashboard fill up over time can be very motivating.\nLearning Python\ndoesn’t have to feel like an uphill battle; gamified learning has changed that. With the right tools, it can be something you look forward to doing, and these apps are a great place to start. They won’t make you an expert developer, but they will provide you with the foundational skills and building blocks necessary to learn Python in a fun and engaging way.\nProgramming\nApps & Web Apps\nGames\nFollow\nFollowed\nLike\nShare\nFacebook\nX\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nFlipboard\nCopy link\nEmail\nReaders like you help support How-To Geek.

Students, and even some educators, have embraced this new technology with enthusiasm, but it's still the Wild West out there.\nSo if you're thinking of using ChatGPT (or something like it), in your new semester or year of study, there are some essential things you should know to avoid gettig into serious trouble, or simply doing more harm than good to your own educational journey.\n7\nIt’s a Tool, Not a Shortcut\nLucas Gouveia / Jason Montoya / How-To Geek\nIt's important to remember\nwhy\nyou're studying in the first place. Many college students are motivated by the end-goal. I.e. getting a degree so that it will unlock opportunities for you later in life. However, that piece of paper is meant to be symbolic of the knowledge, skills, and competencies you've developed during your studies.\nWhile a tool like ChatGPT can really supercharge your learning if you use it right, if you\nmisuse\nit you'll end up learning nothing and gaining no skills or competencies of your own. Even with a degree under the belt, it's very hard to start a career. Doing that with a degree you didn't earn and a total lack of preparation will just result in disaster.\n6\nYour Professors Will Notice Lazy AI Work\nBongkarnGraphic / Shutterstock.com\nWhile\nAI detection tools\ndon't work, and realistically can't ever work as AI output becomes truly indistinguishable from real human writing, you may feel pretty confident getting an all-clear from these tools when running generated text through them.\nHowever, these AI text generation bots aren't yet sophisticated enough to create anything more than mediocre D-grade work at the college level. Your professor might not know for sure that your work was generated by an AI, but they will know it's of middling quality and contains no original thought. While they might not be able to prove you didn't write the work yourself, that doesn't prevent them from giving you the grade that lazy work deserves.\n5\nPlagiarism Policies May Include AI Use\nLucas Gouveia / How-To Geek | Melnikov Dmitriy /\nShutterstock\nWhile colleges have been slow to respond to ChatGPT suddenly dropping in on them, official policies around academic dishonesty and conduct are being updated across the world. They know about AI, they've used it, evaluated it, and have put guidelines into place.\nThis means that if you use AI in a way that goes against the policy, and they can prove it somehow, you'll be in hot water. That said, most institutions recognize that generative AI is here to stay and that it will be part of the real-world working environment for you after graduation.\nSo, in most cases, AI use isn't being banned, it's just being regulated. This usually means there's a list of things you are allowed to use ChatGPT or other similar tools for, and rules on when and where you need to disclose it. Follow these rules to the letter and you're going to be just fine.\n4\nChatGPT Can Be Wrong (Confidently So)\nJustin Duino / Review Geek\nAll AI chatbots suffer from \"\nhallucinations\n\" where the bot will confidently make up facts that aren't true. Because the chatbot is articulate and convincing, you might simply accept that what it says is true, because you don't have the expertise to evaluate what it tells you.\nTools like ChatGPT are most useful in the hands of someone who is already a subject expert, because they can usually sniff out mistakes or reasoning errors. If you don't actually know anything about the subject, you're likely to get burned by this issue. This is why you should double-check every factual statement the chatbot makes. This is actually an excellent way to build your own expertise, because critically engaging with a text is exactly the sort of intellectual exercise that turns you into an expert.\n3\nIt’s Great for Brainstorming, Not Copy-Pasting\nOpenAI | Andrew Heinzman / How-To Geek\nAs a writer, I use ChatGPT as a way to boost my productivity, but not in the way you might think. I don't use the bot to actually write anything for me, but instead I use it as a brainstorming tool. The hardest part of my job isn't the actual writing bit. I can do that better and faster than ChatGPT any day of the week, given that I would effectively have to edit and rewrite all of its output before being happy with it anyway. It would take more time, not less!\nNo, instead the best thing about ChatGPT is that you can use it as an endless idea generator. You can engage in a back-and-forth with it to come up with ideas, then explore those ideas and drill down into the structures of arguments, or what issues should be included in the discussion. It's also an awesome tool to get instant editorial feedback.\nThis means you can improve your grades not by having ChatGPT do the work for you, but by having it collaborate with you to prepare a plan, and then give feedback on your drafts to polish it up. This is the best of both worlds, because you've done the mental work expected of you, and you'll learn through the feedback loop as you polish your work.\n2\nYou Can Use It to Understand, Not Just Generate\nLucas Gouveia / How-To Geek\nThe best way to really understand a topic isn't to simply read a textbook or attend a lecture. It's when you engage in a dialogue with someone else, and wrestle with those ideas. This is why it's valuable to have debates even with other students on the same level as you, but also with experts.\nIt's not just about absorbing facts, education in a field is meant to help you learn how to think like someone from that field. Lawyers, scientists, and other professionals have a particular way of looking at the world that suits the needs of the professions. You can learn all the facts you want about the human body, but that doesn't make you a doctor. Thinking like a doctor and applying that knowledge within a specific framework is what being a doctor really is.\nSomething like ChatGPT can't replace having this experience with real humans, but it can certainly augment and simulate it. You can use it to build your debating skills and have it challenge you. It might be helpful to learn how to make\nChatGPT personas\n, such as telling ChatGPT that it should act like an architect or an anthropologist, depending on your needs.\n1\nIt Won’t Replace Your Sources or Citations\nYou can't cite generative AI as a source in your work ever. Mainly because it can't be trusted not to make up facts. This isn't just true for ChatGPT or AI chatbots specifically, but any service that generates answers using AI. For example, the AI Overviews at the top of some Google searches cannot be used as a source, as it can also just make stuff up.\nThe best strategy here is to ask the bot to provide the sources for its facts and then read those sources yourself to verify that it's telling the truth. Then you should cite\nthose\nsources, assuming they meet the quality criteria set out in your course.\nOne of the most important skills that any student should learn today is how to use AI tools effectively to make them more productive, more knowledgeable, and more competent. You can use the AI to support you while you spend more time doing things that have the biggest impact on your learning.\nJust be careful that you don't lean on these tools so much that you come out less smart than you went in!\nCutting Edge\nBack to School\nAI (Artificial Intelligence)\nFollow\nFollowed\nLike\nShare\nFacebook\nX\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nFlipboard\nCopy link\nEmail\nReaders like you help support How-To Geek.

Offer ends September 7th, 2025.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nLUBA Mini AWD Series\nMammotion LUBA Mini\nA tiny but mighty all-terrain mower for small to medium gardens.\nSee at Mammotion\nExpand\nCollapse\nWhen you want to brave treacherous terrain in a car, you want an all-wheel-drive system to ensure you don't get stuck and can make it up steep inclines safely. That's exactly the same philosophy behind Mammotion's AWD mowers, including the\nLUBA Mini AWD Series\n. These compact mowers are perfect for lawns up to 1500㎡ in size, and can handle 80% slopes thanks to every wheel providing traction when needed.​​​​​​​\nMammotion\nAWD isn't the only amazing feature packed into this little mower. You get RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) sensor technology combined with AI-powered vision to imbue the mower with exceptional obstacle recognition and avoidance. This lets the mower work in GPS blind spots, detect edges with high accuracy, and there's no need for a perimeter wire, and you get access to Mammotion's \"3D lawn printing\" feature, which can embed designs into your lawn.\nThe mini series offers up to 180 minutes of operation, but will auto-recharge and continue the job until it's done.

In fact, Mammotion estimates that 99% of residential lawns would be a perfect fit for the\nYUKA mini\n, which is a cost-effective automated lawn care solution aimed at the everyday needs most people have when it comes to garden care.​​​​​​​\nMammotion\nWhile the YUKA mini is only designed to handle 50% slopes, it's no less intelligent than the AWD models, offering the same fundamental AI system for object detection and intelligent mapping, and route planning. You get the same navigation technology, which means no annoying guide wire installation, and you can have the same creative fun with lawn printing.\nThe YUKA's UltraSense AI Vision technology gives it the same performance as an L3 autonomous car, so you know it's seriously capable when navigating the environment of your backyard.\nGrab the YUKA mini 600/H for $350 off its regular price of $1,099, discounted to $749, or the YUKA mini 800/H for $350 off its regular price of $1299, discounted to $949.

It will intelligently sweep your grass, and then automatically empty those leaves out for disposal.\nMammotion\nAttaching the sweeper kit does limit the slopes that the YUKA can handle, but for appropriate lawns, this represents automation of possibly the most dreaded garden chore there is. So if you lie awake at night as Autumn approaches, and seriously consider just cutting down all your trees instead of sweeping up leaves for the rest of your life, the YUKA is calling your name.\nOptional sweeping superpowers aside, the YUKA has all the same cutting-edge technological features as the other Mammotion mowers above. Advanced vision, lawn-mapping, wire-free installation, and offers the same carpet-like lawn finish you get with every Mammotion mower equipped with floating cutting discs.\nSave $200 on the YUKA, regularly $1,499, now just $1,299.

    "content": "How to Make a Dog Collar\n\nA dog collar is not only a practical accessory for your pet but also a reflection of their personality and style. Whether you’re looking to provide safety and identification or simply enhance your dog’s appearance, making your own collar can be a rewarding and creative project.\n\nIn this guide on how to make a dog collar, we will walk you through the necessary materials, steps, and tips to craft a custom dog collar that suits your furry friend perfectly. By the end, you’ll have a unique collar tailored to your dog’s needs and your personal taste.\n\nWhy Make Your Own Dog Collar?\n\nThere are several reasons why making your own dog collar can be beneficial. Firstly, store-bought collars often come in limited sizes and designs, which may not fit or suit your dog’s individual needs. By making one yourself, you have full control over the size, materials, and design of the collar.\n\nSecondly, custom-made dog collars can save you money in the long run. While high-quality materials may cost more upfront, they will likely last longer than cheaper store-bought options that need to be replaced frequently.\n\nLastly, making a dog collar is a fun and creative activity that allows you to bond with your pet while also expressing their unique personality. Plus, you can add personalized touches or special features that are not available in store-bought collars.\n\nMaterials You Will Need\n\nTo make a basic dog collar, you will need the following materials:\n\nNylon Webbing or Fabric of Your Choice:\n\nThis will serve as the base of your collar. Nylon webbing is durable, easy to clean, and readily available at most craft stores. However, you can also use fabric for a softer, more unique look.\n\nPlastic or Metal Buckle:\n\nChoose a buckle that matches the width of your chosen material and is sturdy enough to withstand your dog’s pulling.\n\nD-ring:\n\nThis is where you will attach your leash. Make sure it is made of strong metal that can support your dog’s weight.\n\nHole Punch:\n\nIf using fabric, you may need this tool to create holes for the buckle and D-ring.\n\nFabric Scissors:\n\nCut the materials to the desired size and shape.\n\nMeasuring Tape:\n\nTo ensure an accurate fit for your dog’s neck.\n\n8 Step-by-step Guidelines on How to Make a Dog Collar\n\nStep 1: Measure Your Dog’s Neck\n\nTo begin creating a custom dog collar, it’s crucial to accurately measure your dog’s neck size. Use a measuring tape and wrap it around the base of your dog’s neck, ensuring it fits snugly but not too tight. Take note of the measurement in inches or centimeters.\n\nTo account for comfort, you may want to add an extra inch (or two) to the measurement, allowing for a bit of adjustability. This will help ensure that your dog’s collar is not only the right size but also comfortable for daily wear.\n\nStep 2: Cut the Material\n\nOnce you have your dog’s neck measurement, it’s time to cut the material to size. Take your nylon webbing or chosen fabric and lay it flat on a clean workspace. Using the measuring tape, measure out a length of material that is the same as the neck measurement, plus the additional allowance you noted for comfort.\n\nFor example, if your dog’s neck measures 15 inches, you may want to cut the material to 16 or 17 inches. Use fabric scissors to cut the material straight across, ensuring that the edges are clean and even. If you’re using nylon webbing, make sure to seal the edges with heat or a lighter to prevent fraying.\n\nStep 3: Create Holes (If Using Fabric)\n\nIf you are using fabric for your dog collar, the next step is to create holes for the buckle and D-ring. Carefully mark the positions where you want to place the buckle and D-ring, ensuring they are evenly spaced and aligned. Using a hole punch, create holes at the marked spots.\n\nMake sure the holes are large enough to allow the buckle and D-ring to fit through comfortably but not so large that they compromise the collar’s integrity. After creating the holes, it’s a good idea to reinforce the edges with a sewing machine or fabric glue to prevent fraying, ensuring the collar will withstand your dog’s movements during wear.\n\nStep 4: Add the Buckle and D-ring\n\nWith the holes created, it’s time to attach the buckle and D-ring to your collar. Start by threading one end of the nylon webbing or fabric through the buckle. Ensure that the side of the buckle that faces your dog’s body is positioned toward the inside of the collar. Pull the material through until you have a few inches of excess material, which will be necessary for securing the buckle.\n\nNext, take the D-ring and thread the same end of the material through it, sliding it all the way to the end of the collar for a secure fit. Finally, fold the excess material back and thread it back through the buckle to create a loop, securing it in place. Depending on the type of buckle you are using, you may need to sew or use a strong adhesive to reinforce the attachment. Make sure everything is snug and secure, as this will provide the foundational strength needed for the collar during use.\n\nStep 5: Adjust the Collar to Fit Your Dog’s Neck\n\nWith the buckle and D-ring securely attached, it’s time to adjust the collar to ensure a perfect fit for your dog. Place the collar around your dog’s neck and fasten the buckle. Make sure it sits comfortably, allowing you to fit two fingers between the collar and your dog’s neck. This ensures that the collar is not too tight or too loose.\n\nIf necessary, you can trim any excess material from the collar for a tailored look while leaving enough to allow for future adjustments, especially if your dog is still growing. Having a properly fitted collar is essential not only for comfort but also for the safety of your furry friend, preventing any risk of choking or irritation.\n\nStep 6: Add Personalized Touches\n\nNow that you have the basic structure of the collar in place, it’s time to infuse it with your dog’s personality through personalized touches. Consider adding embellishments such as decorative patches, embroidery, or even fabric paint to enhance the visual appeal. If you’re skilled with a sewing machine, you might customize it further by stitching your dog’s name or a fun pattern along the collar.\n\nAnother great option is to attach a charm or tag with your contact information, which can be both stylish and practical in keeping your pet safe. Remember to ensure that any additions do not compromise the collar’s functionality or comfort—your dog’s comfort should always come first!\n\nStep 7: Test the Durability\n\nBefore allowing your dog to wear the new collar, it’s essential to conduct a durability test to ensure it can withstand daily wear and tear. Start by gently tugging on both the buckle and D-ring to check for any signs of weakness or instability. Ensure that the stitching is secure, especially if you made any custom additions, and that the holes created are not showing signs of tearing.\n\nYou can also simulate typical dog activities by taking the collar outdoors and lightly tugging it while it’s secured on an object approximately representing your dog’s neck size. This will help confirm that the collar remains intact under stress. If everything holds up well, you can confidently allow your dog to wear the collar, knowing it is both safe and durable for their adventures.\n\nStep 8: Regularly Check and Replace if Needed\n\nJust like any other piece of equipment, dog collars are subject to wear and tear. It’s essential to regularly check the collar for any signs of damage or weakness, especially if your dog is particularly active or enjoys rough play. If you notice any issues, it’s best to replace the collar immediately to prevent any potential safety hazards.\n\nAs a general rule, it’s recommended to replace your dog’s collar every six months to a year, depending on usage and the type of material used. This will help ensure that your furry friend always has a strong and comfortable collar, keeping them safe during their daily adventures.\n\nAdditional Tips\n\nChoose the Right Material:\n\nWhen selecting the material for your dog collar, consider your dog’s lifestyle. For active dogs, durable materials like nylon or leather are ideal, while softer fabrics may be better suited for smaller or less active breeds.\n\nUse Reflective Material:\n\nIf your dog enjoys nighttime walks, consider incorporating reflective materials or strips into the collar design. This will enhance visibility and keep your furry friend safe in low-light conditions.\n\nRegular Cleaning:\n\nKeep your dog’s collar clean by washing it regularly, especially if your pup loves to explore outdoors. Most fabric collars can be machine-washed, but always check care instructions before laundering.\n\nMonitor for Allergies:\n\nPay attention to any signs of irritation or allergic reactions that your dog may have to the collar material. If you notice any redness or discomfort, it may be time to try a different fabric.\n\nInvolve Your Dog:\n\nLet your dog get involved in the process by allowing them to “try on” options for fit and comfort, ensuring they are comfortable with the final design and fit of their new collar.\n\nFollowing these steps and tips on how to make a dog collar will help you create a personalized, safe, and durable collar for your furry friend. Remember to always prioritize comfort and safety when making any adjustments or modifications to the collar. With a well-fitted and stylish collar, your dog will be ready for all their adventures in style!\n\nConclusion\n\nCreating a custom dog collar can be a rewarding project that not only showcases your creativity but also provides your pet with a unique accessory tailored to their needs. By following the steps on how to make a dog collar outlined, you ensure a functional and stylish collar that fits comfortably and securely. Regular maintenance and timely replacements will help keep your dog safe and comfortable for all their adventures.\n\nWhether you’re expressing their personality through design or simply ensuring their safety, the effort put into making a custom collar undoubtedly strengthens the bond between you and your furry companion.",

These bags serve as a calming tool, offering a safe space for exploration and creative play. Unlike traditional sensory bags that often use hair gel as a base, this guide on how to make a sensory bag without hair gel will show you how to make your very own version using simple household materials.\nWhether you’re aiming to promote relaxation, focus, or sensory exploration, this DIY sensory bag can be tailored to meet various needs and preferences, all while providing hours of interactive fun. So, let’s get started and create a unique sensory bag without using any hair gel.\nMaterials\nPlastic Resealable Bags (Gallon Size):\nThese are the perfect size for sensory bags and can be easily resealed for multiple uses. Make sure to choose durable and thick bags to prevent any leaks.\nClear Hair Gel Alternative:\nInstead of using hair gel, we will be using a clear hand sanitizer or lotion as our base. This will provide a similar texture without the mess and stickiness.\nFood Coloring:\nChoose your desired colors to add some visual stimulation to your sensory bag.\nSmall Toys/Objects:\nThis is where you can get creative! Choose small toys or objects that will add different textures and shapes to your sensory bag. Some ideas include plastic beads, buttons, pompoms, or glitter.\nDuct Tape:\nThis will be used to seal the bag and prevent any leaks or spills.\nOptional Ingredients:\nYou can also add other ingredients such as\nessential oils\n, glitter glue, or even scented markers, for an added sensory experience.\n8 Step-by-step Guides on How to Make a Sensory Bag Without Hair Gel\nStep 1: Prepare\nBegin by gathering all your materials in a clean, flat workspace. Lay out the plastic resealable bags, clear hand sanitizer or lotion, food coloring, small toys or objects, duct tape, and any optional ingredients you wish to include.\nThis will ensure you have everything you need at your fingertips, making the process smoother and more enjoyable. Once your materials are organized, clean the area to avoid contamination in your sensory bag. Make sure your hands are clean as well, as you will be handling items that will go into the bag.\nStep 2: Add the Base\nNow that your workspace is ready, it’s time to add the base for your sensory bag. Open the plastic resealable bag and pour in a generous amount of the clear hand sanitizer or lotion, filling it about one-third full. This will provide the watery, gel-like texture that makes sensory bags so fun to explore.\nIf desired, you can also mix in a few drops of food coloring at this stage to create a visually appealing base that will enhance the overall sensory experience. Once you’ve added the base, seal the bag partially to remove any excess air before proceeding to the next step.\nStep 3: Add the Objects\nThis is where you can let your creativity shine! Begin by adding small toys or objects into the bag, such as plastic beads, buttons, or pompoms. You can also add glitter for some extra sparkle and use different textures to provide a wide range of sensory experiences. Be mindful of any sharp edges that could puncture the bag and cause leaks.\nIt’s best to stick with small items that won’t take up too much space in the bag, allowing for more room for exploring and manipulating them. Once all your desired objects are added, seal the bag completely, removing as much air as possible.\nStep 4: Optional Ingredients\nIf you want to enhance the sensory experience further, now is the time to add any optional ingredients. Consider incorporating a few drops of essential oils like lavender or peppermint for a soothing scent, which can promote relaxation and create a calming atmosphere. Glitter glue can be added for a fun visual element that adds to the overall aesthetic of your sensory bag.\nAlternatively, you can include scented markers to provide a unique smell as children explore the bag. Just be sure that any additions are safe and suitable for the age of the child who will be using the sensory bag. Once you’ve added your optional ingredients, gently mix them in without causing any leaks before sealing the bag securely.\nStep 5: Double Bagging\nTo ensure maximum durability and to prevent any potential spills, it’s a great idea to double-bag your sensory creation. Start by placing your sealed sensory bag inside another plastic resealable bag of the same size. This extra layer of protection will help contain the contents in case of any leaks or punctures that might occur during play.\nMake sure to seal the outer bag securely, removing any excess air as you did with the first bag. This step not only enhances the longevity of your sensory bag but also adds an additional barrier for safe exploration, allowing children to enjoy the tactile experience without stress.\nStep 6: Seal With Duct Tape\nNow, it’s time to ensure your sensory bag is completely secure. Take a length of duct tape and wrap it around the opening of the resealable bag, covering the zipper securely. This step is crucial for preventing any leaks or spills while the sensory bag is being used. Make sure to press down firmly on the tape to create a tight seal, ensuring that the bag remains intact during play.\nIf desired, you can also place additional strips of duct tape along the edges for extra reinforcement. Once sealed, you’re ready to move on to the final step, making sure your sensory bag is both safe and durable for fun exploration.\nStep 7: Test and Explore!\nCongratulations, your sensory bag is now complete! Before handing it over to little hands, give the bag a gentle shake or squeeze to make sure there are no leaks. Once you’re confident that everything is securely sealed, it’s time for the best part – exploring and discovering all the different textures and colors inside!\nEncourage children to press on the bag with their hands or feet, move objects around, or tilt the bag in different directions for a tactile exploration experience. The options are endless! Just make sure to supervise young children while they play with the sensory bag.\nStep 8: Store and Reuse\nAfter playtime is over, make sure to store the sensory bag in a safe place away from direct sunlight or extreme heat. This will prevent any potential damage and ensure that the bag can be reused multiple times for continued fun and learning experiences. If any spills or leaks occur during play, simply discard the bag and create a new one using these easy steps.\nMaking a sensory bag without hair gel is an excellent way to stimulate children’s senses while providing a fun and engaging activity they can enjoy on their own or with friends. So gather your materials, follow these step-by-step instructions on how to make a sensory bag without hair gel, and let the sensory exploration begin!\nHow Much Could It Cost?\nCreating a sensory bag is a budget-friendly project that can be tailored to fit various financial plans. The primary materials, such as resealable plastic bags,\nclear hand sanitizer\nor lotion, and optional decorative items like plastic beads or glitter, are typically inexpensive and often found at local dollar or craft stores. On average, you might spend anywhere from $5 to $15 for the base supplies needed to assemble a basic sensory bag.\nIf you choose to incorporate essential oils or more specialized items, the cost could increase slightly, but you can still easily keep the total under $30. Additionally, many of the materials can be reused for future sensory bags, making this a cost-effective activity for ongoing enjoyment and learning.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: What Age Range is Suitable for Sensory Bags?\nA: Sensory bags can be enjoyed by children of all ages, but it’s best to supervise younger children to ensure safe play. It’s also important to consider any potential choking hazards and choose appropriate objects and ingredients.\nQ: How Often Can I Reuse a Sensory Bag?\nA: As long as the bag remains intact and free from leaks or punctures, it can be reused multiple times. Just make sure to store it properly after each use. If any spills or leaks occur, it’s best to discard the bag and create a new one.\nQ: Can I Use Other Ingredients Besides Hair Gel for Sensory Bags?\nA: Absolutely! There are many alternative ingredients that you can use instead of hair gel, such as hand sanitizer, lotion, or even baby oil. Just make sure to check for potential allergies or sensitivities before using them in your sensory bag.\nQ: Are Sensory Bags Safe for Children with Special Needs?\nA: Sensory bags can be beneficial for children with special needs as they provide a safe and stimulating way to engage their senses. However, it’s important to consider any individual sensitivities and choose appropriate objects and ingredients. It’s also recommended to consult with a therapist or doctor for personalized recommendations.\nConclusion\nCreating a sensory bag without hair gel is a rewarding way to support children’s sensory development while providing an engaging and interactive experience. By following these simple steps on how to make a sensory bag without hair gel, you can craft a versatile resource that not only captivates their interest but also encourages exploration and learning through touch, sight, and smell.\nWhether for play at home or in a therapeutic setting, sensory bags can adapt to various needs and preferences, making them an excellent tool for all ages. Remember to always supervise play and ensure the materials used are safe, fostering a carefree environment where children can enjoy their discoveries. With creativity and care, the possibilities for sensory exploration are truly endless!\nElizabeth Davis\nElizabeth is a creative writer and digital editor based in the United States.

    "content": "How to Make a Chevron Pattern\n\nCreating a chevron pattern is a fantastic way to add visual interest and modern flair to various projects, from home decor to fashion design. This classic zigzag motif can be easily incorporated into textiles, wallpapers, and digital designs, making it a versatile choice for both DIY enthusiasts and professional designers alike.\n\nIn this guide on how to make a chevron pattern, we will explore the steps required to craft a stunning chevron pattern, along with tips and techniques to ensure your creation stands out. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned crafter, this process is sure to inspire your creativity and elevate your design projects.\n\nWhat is a Chevron Pattern?\n\nBefore we dive into the step-by-step process, let’s briefly discuss what exactly a chevron pattern is. A chevron pattern consists of inverted V-shaped lines that are repeated to create a continuous and symmetrical design. The name “chevron” is derived from the French word “chevrons,” which means rafter or roof tile, as the pattern resembles overlapping tiles on a roof.\n\nChevron patterns have been around for centuries and can be found in various cultures and art forms, such as ancient Greek pottery and Native American textiles. In modern times, the chevron motif has become increasingly popular in fashion and interior design due to its bold yet elegant appearance.\n\nMaterials Needed\n\nTo create a chevron pattern, you will need the following materials:\n\nBase Material:\n\nThis can be any surface or fabric that you want to apply the chevron pattern on. Some popular options include paper, canvas, wood, and clothing items. Make sure to choose a sturdy and flat surface for the best results.\n\nPaint or Ink:\n\nYou can use any type of paint or ink, depending on your project’s requirements. Acrylic paint works well on most surfaces, while fabric paints are ideal for textiles. For a more traditional look, you can also use natural dyes or inks.\n\nTo create precise lines and angles, you will need some tools such as a ruler, protractor, pencil, and painter’s tape. These will help you achieve clean and symmetrical chevron patterns.\n\n8 Steps on How to Make a Chevron Pattern\n\nStep 1: Choose Your Base Material\n\nSelecting the right base material is crucial for the success of your chevron pattern project. Consider the final use of your pattern – whether it’s for a wall, a piece of clothing, or a decorative item. For home decor, sturdy materials like canvas or wood can provide a solid foundation for your design. If you’re working on textiles, opt for fabric that has a tight weave to ensure even application of paint or ink.\n\nAdditionally, ensure that the surface is clean and free of dust or grease, as this will promote better adhesion and prevent any imperfections in your pattern. Once you have chosen your base material, you’ll be ready to move on to preparing it for your chevron design.\n\nStep 2: Determine the Size of Your Chevron Pattern\n\nBefore you begin, it’s essential to decide on the size and scale of your chevron pattern. This will depend on the dimensions of your base material and your personal preference. You can use a ruler or measuring tape to determine the width and length of each V-shape in your pattern.\n\nKeep in mind that a larger scale will create a bolder statement, while a smaller scale can provide more delicate details.\n\nStep 3: Draw Guide Lines\n\nUsing a pencil, lightly draw guidelines on your base material to help keep your chevron pattern straight and uniform. These guidelines should be parallel to each other and equally spaced apart. If you’re working on a large surface, you may need to use a ruler or measuring tape to ensure accuracy.\n\nYou can also use a protractor to create precise angles for your chevron lines. Remember, the more accurate your guidelines are, the cleaner and more professional your finished pattern will look.\n\nStep 4: Apply Painter’s Tape\n\nOnce you have drawn your guidelines, use painter’s tape or ink to cover the areas that you don’t want to paint or ink on. This will help create clean and crisp edges between each V-shape in your chevron pattern. Make sure the tape is firmly pressed onto the base material to prevent any paint from seeping underneath.\n\nIt’s also a good idea to use different widths of painter’s tape for variation in your pattern. You can create thicker or thinner lines by using wider or narrower tape.\n\nStep 5: Choose Your Paint or Ink\n\nNow it’s time to select the paint or ink that you will use for your chevron pattern. Consider the color palette of your project and choose hues that complement or contrast with it. You can also mix colors to create custom shades for a unique look.\n\nIf you’re working with fabric, make sure to use fabric paints or dyes that are suitable for your chosen textile. This will ensure the longevity and durability of your design.\n\nStep 6: Paint or Ink Your Pattern\n\nWith all your preparations complete, it’s time to start creating your chevron pattern! Apply the paint or ink along the guidelines using a brush or roller, making sure to stay within the taped areas. For a more textured effect, you can also try dabbing or stippling with a sponge.\n\nIt may be helpful to start from the bottom of your base material and work your way up, maintaining a steady hand and following the guidelines as closely as possible. If you’re using multiple colors, let each layer dry completely before moving on to the next.\n\nStep 7: Remove Painter’s Tape\n\nOnce your paint or ink has dried completely, it’s time to carefully remove the painter’s tape. Start by gently peeling the tape off at a 45-degree angle, which will help prevent any paint from lifting along with it. Take your time during this step to avoid smudging or damaging your newly created chevron pattern. If you notice any areas where paint may have seeped under the tape, you can use a small brush or a cotton swab dipped in the same color to touch up those spots.\n\nWith the tape removed, you’ll reveal sharp, clean lines that bring your chevron design to life. Now that the refining process is complete, you can proudly admire your vibrant and stylish creation!\n\nStep 8: Optional Finishing Touches\n\nTo add some extra details to your chevron pattern, you can use different techniques such as stenciling or adding glitter or sequins. You can also experiment with different paintbrush strokes for a more abstract look.\n\nFor fabric projects, consider using fabric pens or markers to add finer details and definitions. Additionally, you can try ironing on heat transfer vinyl in a contrasting color for an eye-catching effect.\n\nFollowing these steps on how to make a chevron pattern, you can create a stunning and professional-looking chevron pattern on almost any surface. Don’t be afraid to get creative and make this classic design your own by using different colors, scales, or materials.\n\nWith practice and patience, you’ll be able to master the art of chevron patterns and incorporate them into all your projects! So go ahead, grab your supplies, and start creating beautiful chevron patterns today! Happy crafting!\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nQ: Can I Use Different Materials for My Chevron Pattern?\n\nA: Yes, you can use a variety of materials such as wood, fabric, or paper, to create your chevron pattern. Just make sure to choose a sturdy material that can withstand the application of paint or ink.\n\nQ: Do I Have to Use Tape for My Chevron Pattern?\n\nA: While using tape helps create clean and crisp lines, it’s not necessary. You can also freehand your chevron pattern if you have steady hands and are comfortable with improvising.\n\nQ: How Many Colors Can I Use in My Chevron Pattern?\n\nA: You can use as many colors as you like in your chevron pattern. However, be mindful of how they will blend or contrast with each other to ensure a cohesive design.\n\nQ: Can I Make Different Sizes of V-Shapes in My Chevron Pattern?\n\nA: Yes, you can vary the size of your V-shapes to add dimension and interest to your chevron pattern. Just make sure to maintain consistency in spacing between each V-shape.\n\nConclusion\n\nCreating a chevron pattern can be a rewarding project that allows you to express your creativity and personalize your space. By following the steps on how to make a chevron pattern outlined above—choosing the right materials, meticulously preparing your surfaces, and applying your chosen paint or ink—you can achieve a professional-looking design that enhances the aesthetic of any item.\n\nWhether you’re decorating a room, designing clothing, or crafting decorative pieces, the chevron pattern’s versatility ensures it will remain a stylish choice for years to come.

    "content": "How to Make Tassels for Scarf\n\nAre you looking for a way to add some flair to your scarves? Look no further—tassels are the perfect solution! Tassels are easy to make and can be customized in any color or size you desire.\n\nHow to make tassels for scarf is a simple yet rewarding craft that adds a touch of flair and personality to your accessories. Whether you are looking to finish off a handmade scarf or give a store-bought one a unique twist, tassels provide both functional and decorative elements.\n\nIn this guide, we will explore the materials needed and the step-by-step process for making beautiful tassels that complement any scarf design. With just a few tools and creativity, you can transform your scarves into stylish statements that showcase your style.\n\nWhat Will You Need?\n\nTo make tassels for the scarf, you will need the following materials:\n\nYarn (in your desired color)\n\nScissors\n\nA piece of cardboard or a small book to wrap the yarn around\n\nOnce you have gathered all your materials, you can start making tassels for your scarf.\n\n10 Easy Steps on How to Make Tassels for Scarf\n\nStep 1. Prepare Your Cardboard:\n\nBegin by cutting a piece of cardboard to the desired width of your tassels. The width will determine the overall length of the tassels once completed. A standard size is about 4 inches, but you can adjust this based on how long you want your tassels to be. If you prefer a quicker option, you can also use a small book instead of cardboard, wrapping the yarn around the book’s cover. Ensure the edges are smooth, as this will aid in the easy removal of the tassels later. Having your cardboard or book ready sets the foundation for creating uniforms and even tassels throughout your project.\n\nStep 2. Wrap the Yarn:\n\nHold your cardboard in one hand and the yarn in the other. Start wrapping the yarn around the cardboard or book, making sure to keep the wraps close together for a fuller tassel. The more times you wrap the yarn, the thicker and fluffier the tassel will be. Typically, wrapping it around 30-50 times gives a good balance between fullness and manageability, but feel free to adjust based on your personal preference.\n\nStep 3. Secure the Top:\n\nTake a separate piece of yarn, around 6 inches long, and slide it under the wrapped sections while keeping the yarn secure. Pull this piece tightly to form a loop at the top of the tassel, making sure it’s snug but not so tight that it distorts the shape. Tie a knot in the yarn to secure it, and if you want to add extra security, a double knot is recommended. This step is crucial, ensuring that your tassel holds its form when you finish it.\n\nStep 4. Cut the Bottom:\n\nNow that you have secured the top of the tassel, it’s time to create the fringe. Carefully cut through the yarn loops at the bottom of the tassel using your scissors. This will separate the strands and give your tassel a fuller appearance. Ensure that you cut evenly across the bottom to avoid any uneven lengths. Once you’ve snipped through the loops, you’ll see the beautiful strands of yarn fanning out, creating the characteristic look of a tassel.\n\nStep 5. Trim the Tassel:\n\nWith the unfurling tassel, it’s time to shape it to your desired look. Hold the tassel by the secured top and gently shake it to separate the strands. Then, use scissors to trim the ends evenly; this will create a polished and tidy appearance. If you prefer a more whimsical look, leave the strands at varying lengths for added character. Take your time during this step, as a well-trimmed tassel will enhance the overall aesthetic of your scarf.\n\nStep 6. Create the Loop:\n\nTo attach the tassel to your scarf, create a loop at the top. Take a length of yarn approximately 12 inches long and position it about an inch below the top of the tassel. Wrap this yarn around the tassel several times, securing it tightly below the knot you previously made. This loop will not only help to hang the tassel but also add an extra decorative element. Once you’re satisfied with the thickness of the loop, tie it off securely, ensuring the knot is tight enough to hold the tassel in place but still allowing for flexibility in movement.\n\nStep 7. Attach the Tassel to Your Scarf:\n\nNow that your tassel is complete, it’s time to attach it to your scarf. Identify where you want to place the tassel, usually at the ends or corners of the scarf for a striking effect. Thread the loop you created in the previous step through the desired scarf area, then pull the tassel snugly into position. For added security, you can sew the loop onto the scarf with a few tiny stitches, ensuring that it stays in place even with wear. Repeat this process for any additional tassels you wish to add, spacing them evenly or clustering them for a bolder look. Your scarf is now transformed with stylish tassels, showcasing your handcrafted touch!\n\nStep 8. Personalize Your Tassels:\n\nOnce you have successfully attached the tassels to your scarf, consider adding a personal touch to enhance their uniqueness. You can incorporate beads, ribbons, or other embellishments by threading them into the strands of the tassels or attaching them directly to the loop before securing the tassel to the scarf. Experiment with different colors and materials that match or contrast with your scarf for a more striking effect.\n\nStep 9. Experiment with Variations:\n\nNow that you’ve mastered the basic tassel-making technique, it’s time to get creative! To achieve unique effects, consider experimenting with different yarn types, such as metallic, ombre, or textured yarns. You can also play with the length and thickness of the tassels, creating varying sizes for an eclectic look. Additionally, try using multiple colors of yarn for each tassel, wrapping them together to produce a vibrant, multicolored design.\n\nStep 10. Care for Your Tassels:\n\nTo keep your tassels looking fresh and vibrant, proper care is essential. Avoid exposing them to excessive moisture and be gentle when washing your scarf, as aggressive handling can damage the tassels. When storing your scarf, consider laying it flat or hanging it to prevent tangles. If your tassels become misshapen, light steam can help to reshape them without damaging the yarn.\n\nBy following these simple steps, you can easily add beautiful tassels to any scarf and elevate your style. Have fun experimenting with different variations and personalizing your tassels to make them one-of-a-kind. With a little bit of creativity and patience, you can create stunning scarves that will be the envy of all your friends!\n\n5 Things You Should Avoid\n\nSkipping the Measurement: Do not neglect to measure your yarn lengths before starting. Without proper measurements, you may end up with tassels that are uneven in size or difficult to attach. Using Poor Quality Yarn: Selecting low-quality yarn can lead to frayed edges and an unappealing look. Always opt for durable and suitable yarn for the scarf’s intended use to ensure longevity and a polished appearance. Overtightening the Knot: While it’s important to secure the tassel effectively, be cautious not to pull the knot too tight, as this can distort the tassel’s shape and make it look uneven. Neglecting to Trim Evenly: Avoid skimping on the trimming process. A hastily cut tassel can appear messy and unprofessional. Take your time to ensure all strands are cut to a uniform length for a more aesthetic finish. Ignoring Care Instructions: Remember to care for your tassels. Failure to follow care guidelines can lead to premature wear and tear, affecting their appearance. Always handle your tassels gently and follow washing instructions to maintain their vibrancy.\n\nBy avoiding these common mistakes, you can ensure your tassels are well-crafted and add the perfect finishing touch to your scarf.\n\nWhat are the Use Cases for Tassels?\n\nScarves: Tassels can add a touch of personalization and style to a scarf, elevating the look of a plain, solid-colored scarf.\n\nTassels can add a touch of personalization and style to a scarf, elevating the look of a plain, solid-colored scarf.

    "content": "How to Make a Waterless Snow Globe\n\nCreating a waterless snow globe is a fun and simple craft that allows you to capture the magic of winter without the mess of water. This project is perfect for both kids and adults and can be customized according to your personal style and preferences. Using readily available materials, you can make a unique decorative piece that can be showcased year-round.\n\nIn this guide on how to make a waterless snow globe, we will walk you through the steps to design your very own waterless snow globe, ensuring that the process is enjoyable and straightforward.\n\nWhy Make a Waterless Snow Globe?\n\nMaking a waterless snow globe offers several advantages that make it an appealing craft project. First and foremost, the absence of water eliminates the worry of leaks and spills, making it a safer option for homes with young children or pets. Additionally, a waterless snow globe requires less maintenance, as there is no need for cleaning or refilling water.\n\nThis craft also allows for greater creativity, as you can use various materials—such as glitter, artificial snow, or personal mementos—to customize your globe’s interior. Furthermore, these snow globes serve as charming decorations that can evoke nostalgia and warmth during the holiday season or any time of year, making them perfect gifts or keepsakes.\n\nMaterials You Will Need\n\nTo create a waterless snow globe, you will need the following materials:\n\nA Clear Glass Jar:\n\nThe foundation of your waterless snow globe is a clear glass jar, which serves as the main container for your design. Choose a jar that is the right size for your intended decoration; small mason jars work well for compact scenes, while larger jars can accommodate more elaborate displays. Ensure the jar has a tight-sealing lid to help contain the decorative elements inside. Glass allows for clear visibility of your creations, showcasing the beauty of your chosen materials, like glitter and figurines, while also giving the final product an elegant touch.\n\nA Base:\n\nYou will also need a base for your snow globe to sit on, as well as provide structure and elevation. This can be a circular piece of wood, cork, or foam board, which you can cut to fit the size of your jar’s lid. Alternatively, you can use an existing object such as a figurine or a small holiday-themed decoration that fits perfectly inside the jar’s opening.\n\nDecorative Elements:\n\nThe fun part of making a waterless snow globe is choosing the decorative elements for the interior. These can include artificial snow, glitter, mini figurines, small holiday decorations like trees or sleighs, or any other materials that suit your design vision. You can mix and match different elements to create a unique and personalized snow globe.\n\nAdhesive:\n\nTo keep your decorative elements in place, you will need an adhesive. Hot glue or super glue are good options for securing materials to the base or inside the jar’s lid. However, if you plan on making changes to your design over time, consider using a less permanent adhesive like tacky glue.\n\nOptional Materials:\n\nDepending on your design vision, you may also want to include some optional materials such as twine or ribbon for decorating the outside of the jar, spray paint for color customization, or a small battery-operated LED light to add a touch of sparkle.\n\n8 Step-by-step Guidelines on How to Make a Waterless Snow Globe\n\nStep 1: Prepare Work Area\n\nBefore you begin crafting your waterless snow globe, it’s important to set up a clean and organized work area. Clear a spacious surface to allow room for all your materials and tools. Lay down a protective covering, such as newspaper or a plastic tablecloth, to catch any spills or stray glue.\n\nGather all your materials, including the glass jar, base, decorative elements, and adhesive, so they’re easily accessible. Make sure you have good lighting in your workspace to help you see small details as you work. Taking these steps will help ensure a smooth and enjoyable crafting experience.\n\nStep 2: Create Base\n\nTo begin crafting your waterless snow globe, start by preparing the base. If you’re using a circular piece of wood, cork, or foam board, cut it to fit the diameter of the glass jar’s lid. Ensure that the base is sturdy enough to support the weight of the jar and its contents. Once cut to size, you can paint or decorate the base if desired, allowing it to complement the theme of your snow globe.\n\nIf you’re using an existing object like a figurine or holiday decoration as the base, make sure it is stable and can hold the jar securely. Once your base is ready, set it aside to be attached later when your decorative elements are in place.\n\nStep 3: Create a Scene Inside the Jar\n\nNow, it’s time to assemble the decorative elements inside your glass jar. Start by selecting the main figurine or centerpiece that will be featured in your snow globe; this could be a small holiday figure, a tree, or any other decorative piece that fits your theme. Once you’ve chosen it, gently place it in the center of the jar. Next, add your artificial snow or glitter around the figurine, ensuring that it settles nicely without overcrowding the scene.\n\nThis is your chance to get creative! You can scatter additional small decorative items, like miniature ornaments or themed accessories, throughout the jar to enhance the visual appeal. Make sure to step back and assess the arrangement, adjusting as needed before securing everything in place. Once you’re satisfied with your scene, it’s time to move on to attaching the lid.\n\nStep 4: Attach Lid to Base\n\nAfter you’ve arranged the decorative elements inside the jar to your satisfaction, it’s time to secure the lid. Start by applying adhesive to the top of the jar’s lid where it meets the base you’ve prepared. If you’re using a circular base, position it centered on the lid and press down firmly to ensure a strong bond. For added stability, you may want to use a heavier-duty adhesive like hot glue or super glue. Allow the adhesive to cure for a few minutes to ensure everything is securely attached.\n\nOnce the lid is firmly affixed to the base, you can proceed to decorate the outer edges if desired or move on to the final touches of your waterless snow globe.\n\nStep 5: Optional Decorative Touches\n\nTo add a finishing touch to your snow globe, consider decorating the outer edges of the glass jar. You can use twine or ribbon to wrap around the lid and tie a bow for a rustic look, or spray paint the jar in a color that complements your scene’s theme.\n\nAnother option is to glue on small decorative items like gems, buttons, or beads for added sparkle and dimension. Get creative and make it your own!\n\nStep 6: Add Personalization\n\nIf you’re making this waterless snow globe as a gift or keepsake, consider adding some personalization to make it extra special. This could be a small name tag tied to the lid with a ribbon or painting a message or design on the base. You could also add a date or special occasion to commemorate the creation of your snow globe.\n\nThe personalization options are endless, so have fun with it and make it meaningful to you or the recipient.\n\nStep 7: Seal the Base\n\nAs a final touch, consider sealing the base of your snow globe with a waterproof sealant such as Mod Podge or clear nail polish. This will help protect the base from moisture and ensure it stays securely attached over time. Allow time for the sealant to dry completely before handling or gifting your waterless snow globe.\n\nThe gloss finish of the sealant can also add a nice touch to the overall design, giving it a polished and professional look.\n\nStep 8: Display and Enjoy!\n\nNow that your waterless snow globe is complete, it’s time to display and enjoy your creation! Find a special spot in your home to showcase your snow globe, whether it’s on a shelf, mantle, or coffee table.\n\nFollowing these easy step-by-step guidelines on how to make a waterless snow globe, you can create a beautiful and unique waterless snow globe that will add charm and holiday cheer to any room. Feel free to experiment and customize your snow globe with different themes, figurines, and decorative elements to make it truly one-of-a-kind. Happy crafting!\n\nConclusion\n\nCreating a waterless snow globe is not only a delightful crafting project but also a wonderful way to express your creativity and imagination. By following the step-by-step guidelines on how to make a waterless snow globe, you can assemble a unique piece that encapsulates cherished memories or festive moments.\n\nWhether you choose to personalize it for a loved one or keep it as a decorative item for yourself, each snow globe tells a story. These charming creations can bring warmth and joy to your home, making them perfect gifts for any occasion. So gather your materials, unleash your creativity, and enjoy the process of crafting your own enchanting waterless snow globe!",

    "content": "How to Use a Dreamcatcher\n\nDreamcatchers, with their intricate designs and rich cultural heritage, are more than just decorative items; they are believed to hold significant spiritual meaning. Originating from Native American traditions, these handcrafted objects are designed to filter out bad dreams while allowing good dreams to pass through. By learning how to use a dreamcatcher, individuals not only embrace an art form but also connect with its traditions and the sense of peace and protection it symbolizes. In this guide, we’ll explore the various ways to incorporate dreamcatchers into your personal space, ensuring that they serve their purpose both as a charming ornament and a tool for restful nights.\n\nCultural Significance of Dreamcatchers\n\nDreamcatchers hold a profound place in the culture and spirituality of many Native American tribes. Traditionally, they are seen as a means of protection, embodying the belief that they can trap negative energies and dreams, allowing only positive thoughts and visions to reach the sleeper. Each component of a dreamcatcher carries symbolism; for instance, the circular shape represents the circle of life and the interconnectedness of all beings. The web within signifies the intricate paths of dreams, while the feathers often symbolize hope and guidance.\n\nUnderstanding the Proper Use of Dreamcatchers\n\nTo effectively use a dreamcatcher, one must first recognize its placement and intention. It is recommended to hang the dreamcatcher above the sleeping area, ideally near the head of the bed or in a corner of the room where it can catch the morning light. This strategic location not only helps in filtering out negative dreams but also enhances its aesthetic appeal as a calming focal point in a personal space. When incorporating a dreamcatcher, it’s important to approach it with a respectful mindset, acknowledging its cultural importance. Additionally, many believe in the power of intention; thus, taking a moment to reflect on one’s desires for restful sleep and positive dreams while hanging or interacting with the dreamcatcher can enhance its effectiveness.\n\n10 Methods How to Use a Dreamcatcher\n\nMethod 1: Understanding the History and Symbolism\n\nBefore using a dreamcatcher, it’s important to understand its history and symbolism. Dreamcatchers originated with the Ojibwe people and were later adopted by other Native American tribes. They are traditionally made from a hoop, often willow, with a web of sinew or cord, and adorned with sacred items such as feathers and beads. The circular shape represents the circle of life, and the web symbolizes protection, catching bad dreams while allowing good dreams to pass through. By appreciating this background, you can use a dreamcatcher with respect and cultural awareness.\n\nMethod 2: Choosing the Right Dreamcatcher\n\nChoosing the right dreamcatcher involves considering both its aesthetic appeal and its symbolic elements. Dreamcatchers come in various sizes, colors, and designs. When selecting one, consider the colors and materials used. Natural materials like wood and feathers are more traditional and align with the original purpose of dreamcatchers. The colors can also have specific meanings; for example, white is often associated with purity and peace, while blue can symbolize tranquility and wisdom. Choose a dreamcatcher that resonates with you personally and fits your intended space.\n\nMethod 3: Placement in the Bedroom\n\nThe most traditional use of a dreamcatcher is placing it in the bedroom to protect the sleeper from bad dreams. Hang the dreamcatcher near your bed, ideally above where you sleep. This position allows it to catch negative dreams in its web while letting positive dreams pass through and slide down the feathers to the sleeper. If you have a window near your bed, you can also hang the dreamcatcher there, as the light from the morning sun is believed to neutralize any trapped bad dreams.\n\nMethod 4: Using Dreamcatchers for Meditation\n\nDreamcatchers can also be used as a focal point during meditation. The intricate patterns and symbols of a dreamcatcher can help you concentrate and enter a meditative state. Hang the dreamcatcher in your meditation space or hold it in your hands while you meditate. Focus on the center of the web and let your mind clear. The dreamcatcher’s presence can create a calming atmosphere, helping you to achieve deeper meditation and mental clarity.\n\nMethod 5: Incorporating Dreamcatchers in Home Decor\n\nBeyond their traditional use, dreamcatchers can be beautiful additions to your home decor. They bring a touch of cultural heritage and artistry to any room. You can hang dreamcatchers in your living room, hallway, or even on your porch. When used as decor, dreamcatchers can symbolize protection and positive energy throughout your home. Choose designs that complement your interior style, whether it’s bohemian, rustic, or modern.\n\nMethod 6: Using Dreamcatchers in Rituals\n\nDreamcatchers can play a role in personal rituals or ceremonies. If you practice any form of spiritual or mindfulness rituals, consider incorporating a dreamcatcher. You can use it during full moon rituals to enhance the energy and intentions you’re setting. Place the dreamcatcher in a central spot, focus on it, and visualize it amplifying your desires and catching any negative energy. This method aligns the dreamcatcher’s traditional protective role with your personal spiritual practices.\n\nMethod 7: Dream Interpretation and Journaling\n\nA dreamcatcher can be a helpful tool for those interested in dream interpretation and journaling. Place a journal and pen near your bed, and hang the dreamcatcher above your sleeping area. Each morning, write down your dreams and any thoughts or feelings they evoke. The presence of the dreamcatcher may enhance your recall of dreams and provide a sense of safety as you explore their meanings. Reflecting on your dreams in the context of the dreamcatcher’s symbolism can offer deeper insights into your subconscious mind.\n\nMethod 8: Teaching Children About Culture\n\nDreamcatchers can be a wonderful educational tool for teaching children about Native American culture and traditions. Explain the history and significance of dreamcatchers to your children, and involve them in creating their own dreamcatcher as a craft project. This hands-on activity can foster respect for different cultures and an appreciation for handmade art. Hang the finished dreamcatcher in their room and explain its purpose, helping them feel protected and connected to a rich cultural heritage.\n\nMethod 9: Gifting Dreamcatchers\n\nDreamcatchers make meaningful gifts for friends and loved ones. When giving a dreamcatcher as a gift, consider its symbolism and choose one that matches the recipient’s personality or needs. For instance, a dreamcatcher with calming blue hues could be ideal for someone seeking peace and relaxation. Write a note explaining the dreamcatcher’s significance and how to use it. This thoughtful gift not only provides aesthetic pleasure but also offers symbolic protection and positive energy.\n\nMethod 10: Personalizing Your Dreamcatcher\n\nPersonalizing a dreamcatcher can enhance its significance and make it uniquely yours. Add elements that have personal meaning, such as charms, crystals, or ribbons. You can also incorporate items that resonate with your personal experiences or spiritual beliefs. For example, if you find peace in nature, add small pine cones or leaves. Personalizing your dreamcatcher can turn it into a powerful talisman that reflects your journey and intentions, enhancing its protective and symbolic power.\n\nMaintenance and Upkeep\n\nTo ensure your dreamcatcher continues to serve its purpose and retains its beauty, regular maintenance is essential. Start by gently dusting your dreamcatcher with a soft cloth or a feather duster to remove any accumulated dirt or debris. If it becomes particularly soiled, you can lightly dampen a cloth with water (avoid soaking the dreamcatcher) and wipe it clean, allowing it to air dry completely before hanging it back up. Additionally, it’s important to check for any damaged or frayed strings and feathers. If you notice any wear and tear, consider repairing it or replacing those elements to maintain its integrity. By taking care of your dreamcatcher, you’ll not only preserve its aesthetic appeal but also enhance its ability to protect and inspire positive energy in your space.\n\nCommon Mistakes to Avoid\n\nWhen using dreamcatchers, there are a few common mistakes that you should be mindful of to ensure you are maximizing their potential benefits. First, avoid placing the dreamcatcher in an area where it is exposed to harsh elements or direct sunlight for extended periods, as this can lead to fading and deterioration of its materials. Second, it’s crucial not to overcrowd the dreamcatcher with excessive charms or decorations; this can detract from its natural beauty and functionality. Additionally, neglecting to properly maintain your dreamcatcher can result in it losing its symbolic power; regular cleaning and checking for damage are essential. Lastly, be cautious about using dreamcatchers solely for aesthetic purposes; their cultural significance should be respected, and they should be used mindfully to honour their origins.\n\nConclusion\n\nDreamcatchers serve as multifaceted tools that extend beyond their traditional role of guarding against nightmares. They offer a blend of cultural significance, aesthetic appeal, and practical uses in everyday life, from enhancing meditation practices to enriching home decor. By incorporating dreamcatchers into various aspects of our lives—whether through ritual, gifting, or personalisation—we not only honour their heritage but also invite positive energy and protection into our spaces. As we engage with dreamcatchers, we deepen our understanding of their meanings and benefits, creating a tangible connection to both our dreams and the cultures that inspire these beautiful creations.",

    "content": "How to Sew Two Pieces of Fabric Together Without Overlapping\n\nHow to sew two pieces of fabric together without overlapping is an essential skill for achieving clean and professional-looking seams in your sewing projects.\n\nWhether you’re working on a garment, a quilt, or a home décor item, mastering this technique allows for a smooth finish and reduces bulk at the seams. This guide will explore various methods and tips to help you sew pieces together seamlessly, ensuring that your final product looks polished and is comfortable to wear or use. Generally, always follow the pattern instructions for seam allowances and use high-quality thread for best results.\n\nWith the right tools and techniques, you can create solid and tidy seams that enhance the overall quality of your work. Let’s dive into the steps needed to achieve this fundamental sewing technique effectively.\n\nWhat Will You Need?\n\nTo sew two pieces of fabric together seamlessly, you will need the following:\n\nSewing machine or needle and thread\n\nFabric scissors\n\nStraight pins or clips\n\nIron and ironing board\n\nSeam gauge or ruler\n\nMarking tool (optional)\n\n10 Easy Steps on How to Sew Two Pieces of Fabric Together Without Overlapping\n\nStep 1: Place the Pieces Right Sides Together\n\nOnce you have gathered all the necessary tools, the next step is to lay out your fabric pieces. Begin by placing the two pieces of fabric with the right sides facing each other. The “right side” refers to the side of the fabric that will be visible in the finished product, while the “wrong side” is the side that will be concealed. Align the edges of the fabric as accurately as possible, ensuring that they are matched at the seams where you plan to sew.\n\nTo secure the pieces in place and prevent any shifting during sewing, use straight pins or clips along the edges that will be stitched. Be careful not to place the pins too close to the seam allowance, as this can interfere with the sewing machine’s foot or needle. If desired, you can use a marking tool to indicate where the seam will be sewn, especially if the pattern requires specific seam allowances. This preliminary step helps achieve a neat, professional finish and is crucial for accurately executing the subsequent sewing steps.\n\nStep 2: Set Your Sewing Machine\n\nBefore you begin stitching, it’s essential to ensure your sewing machine is correctly set up for the best results. First, choose the appropriate stitch type based on the fabric you are working with; a straight stitch is commonly used for most seams, while a zigzag stitch may be suitable for stretch fabrics to prevent fraying. Next, adjust the stitch length according to the thickness of the fabric—typically, a shorter stitch length is ideal for lighter fabrics, while a longer stitch is better for heavier ones. Don’t forget to check that your needle is threaded correctly and that the bobbin is filled and securely placed, as a seamless public appearance also relies heavily on the machine’s performance.\n\nStep 3: Prepare to Sew\n\nOnce your machine is ready, it’s time to position the fabric pieces under the presser foot. Align the raw edges of the fabric with the presser foot edge and lower the foot to hold the fabric in place. For added accuracy, use a seam gauge or ruler to ensure the fabric edges are matched against the desired seam allowance, which is typically between ¼ inch to ½ inch, depending on your project. Before you start sewing, lift the needle slightly to check that the fabric is aligned correctly and that there’s no bunching, which can lead to an uneven seam.\n\nStep 4: Begin Sewing\n\nStart sewing by gently pressing the foot pedal, allowing the machine to stitch comfortably—avoid rushing to maintain control over the fabric. Keep your hands lightly guiding the fabric without pulling or pushing it, as this could distort the seams. As you approach the straight pins or clips you placed in the previous step, remove them one by one to avoid sewing over them, which can damage the needle. If your stitching requires reversing at the beginning and end of a seam for reinforcement, remember to use the reverse stitch function at the start to secure the thread.\n\nStep 5: Finish the Seam\n\nWhen you reach the desired endpoint of your seam, stop the machine with the needle down in the fabric. Raise the presser foot and pivot your work, for example, if you are working with corners. Once you’re ready to finish the seam, either backtrack for reinforcement or simply lift the foot and gently pull the fabric out, cutting the threads approximately ¼ inch from the seam. Remember to tidy any loose threads to maintain a clean appearance.\n\nStep 6: Press the Seams\n\nTo give your finished seam a polished look, pressing it open using an iron is essential. Lay the seam flat first, then carefully iron both sides of the fabric, ensuring the heat setting is appropriate for the fabric type to prevent burns or scorch marks. This step not only enhances the visual aesthetics but also helps to set the stitches securely in place, reducing the likelihood of any fraying or unraveling over time.\n\nStep 7: Finish the Raw Edges\n\nTo prevent fraying and ensure longevity in your sewing projects, finishing the raw edges of your seams is essential. You can use several methods, depending on your preference and the fabric type. Overlocking with a serger is an efficient way to create a clean edge, and using a zigzag stitch on a regular sewing machine can also effectively secure the fabric. If you’re working with delicate fabrics, consider using French seams or bias binding for a neater finish. Whatever method you choose, trim any excess fabric as needed, keeping the overall project looking tidy and professional.\n\nStep 8: Inspect the Seam\n\nAfter pressing and finishing the raw edges, take a moment to inspect your seam for any irregularities. Look for gaps, puckering, or uneven stitches that may need to be addressed. If you notice any issues, don’t hesitate to make adjustments, such as re-sewing or using a seam ripper to correct any mistakes. Ensuring that your seam is neat and robust at this stage is crucial for your project’s overall durability and appearance. A careful inspection can also help you identify any areas needing reinforcement before proceeding with further assembly or finishing touches on your sewing project.\n\nStep 9: Assemble Your Project\n\nOnce all seams are finished and inspected, it’s time to assemble the various components of your project. Begin by laying out all the pieces according to your pattern or design, ensuring that all pieces are oriented correctly. This is a crucial opportunity to visualize how the elements will fit together, highlighting any adjustments needed before sewing. Pin or clip the pieces together as per your sewing plan, making sure to align any necessary edges or notches. When you’re satisfied with the arrangement, proceed to sew these pieces together, following the same principles of careful alignment and seam securing you’ve used in previous steps. This assembly stage is integral as it brings your sewing project closer to completion, allowing you to see your vision come to life.\n\nStep 10: Add Finishing Touches\n\nWith your project assembled, it’s time to add the finishing touches to elevate its final presentation. Depending on your design, this may include adding buttons, zippers, or decorative elements such as embroidery or embellishments. Take care to attach these items securely, ensuring they align well with the overall aesthetic of your project. If your piece requires hems or facings, now is the time to finish those edges as well, maintaining a neat and professional appearance. Finally, give your finished project a final press with the iron to smooth out any wrinkles and help achieve that polished look, making it ready for its debut.\n\nBy following these ten essential steps, you can create beautiful, professional-looking seams and elevate your sewing projects to new heights.\n\n5 Things You Should Avoid\n\nNeglecting to Pre-Wash Fabrics: Skipping the pre-washing step can lead to unwanted shrinkage or color bleeding after completing your project. Always pre-wash your fabric to avoid these issues. Forgetting to Use Proper Seam Allowance: Using inconsistent seam allowances can result in uneven edges and unsightly seams. Always measure and adhere to the required seam allowance for your project. Ignoring Fabric Grain Direction: Cutting pieces against the fabric grain can cause distortion and affect the drape of your project. Pay attention to the grain and cut accordingly for the best results. Not Using Sufficient Pins or Clips: Underpinning your fabric pieces may lead to shifting during sewing, resulting in misaligned seams. Use enough pins or clips to secure the layers properly before sewing. Rushing the Sewing Process: Hurrying can compromise the quality of your stitches and lead to mistakes. Sew at a controlled pace, ensuring accuracy and precision throughout the process.\n\nConclusion\n\nHow to sew two pieces of fabric together without overlapping is a fundamental skill that enhances the quality and professionalism of your projects.\n\nBy carefully following the steps outlined—such as proper alignment, meticulous seam securing, and using the right techniques for finishing edges—you can achieve clean, precise seams that maintain the integrity of the fabric. Remember to inspect your work and make adjustments as necessary to ensure that your seams are neat and strong.\n\nWith practice and attention to detail, you’ll become adept at creating beautifully finished projects that showcase your sewing abilities. Embrace the process, and take pride in each stitch as you bring your creative visions to life.",

    "content": "How to Cut Out a Shamrock\n\nAre you looking for ways to cut out a shamrock? Look no further. We have some easy techniques that will help you create perfect shamrocks every time.\n\nHow to cut out a shamrock is a delightful and creative activity that can add a touch of festive flair to your St. Patrick’s Day celebrations or simply serve as a fun craft for all ages. With its iconic three leaves representing faith, hope, and love, the shamrock symbolizes Irish culture and tradition.\n\nIn this guide, we will walk you through the essential steps and tips to create your very own shamrock cutout, whether you plan to use it for decorations, cards, or educational purposes. Get ready to unleash your creativity and bring some luck to your projects!\n\nWhat Will You Need?\n\nBefore we dive into the instructions, let’s ensure you have all the necessary materials to create your shamrock cutout. Here’s a list of what you’ll need:\n\nGreen construction paper or cardstock\n\nScissors\n\nPencil\n\nOptional: Glue, glitter, markers or any other decorative elements you may want to add\n\nOnce you have gathered all the supplies, let’s move on to the fun part – cutting out your own shamrock!\n\n10 Easy Steps on How to Cut Out a Shamrock\n\nStep 1: Preparing Your Materials\n\nTo begin with, gather all your materials in one place. Ensure that the green paper you have chosen is thick enough to hold its shape and will not tear easily when cutting. You can opt for different shades of green to add depth and dimension to your shamrock.\n\nOnce you have your paper and scissors ready, you can start creating your shamrock cutout.\n\nStep 2: Fold Your Paper in Half\n\nBegin by taking your green construction paper or cardstock and folding it in half lengthwise. This fold is crucial as it will help you achieve symmetry in your shamrock cutout. When cutting, the fold allows you to create a mirrored shape, making the process easier and ensuring that both sides of your shamrock match perfectly. Once the paper is folded, press firmly on the crease to create a sharp line. This will guide your cutting and help keep your shamrock symmetrical. For added creativity, you can experiment with the fold size; more minor folds will result in a more compact shamrock, while more prominent folds will create a broader design.\n\nStep 3: Draw the Shamrock Shape\n\nWith your folded paper, it’s time to draw the shamrock shape. Start by sketching the outline of one of the leaves at the top of the folded edge. Each leaf should be a rounded heart shape, allowing for a soft and organic look. You can make the leaves as large or as small as you desire, but remember that they should be proportionate to each other. Once you’re happy with your drawing, ensure that the bottom of the leaves connects at a central point on the fold, forming a stem. Use a pencil to adjust your design if needed quickly for the best results.\n\nStep 4: Cut Out the Shamrock Shape\n\nNow it’s time to cut out the shamrock shape you’ve drawn carefully. Using your scissors, start at the top of the folded edge and slowly cut along the outline of the leaves. Take your time to ensure that your cuts are smooth and closely follow your design’s curves. Remember, since the paper is folded, cutting through both layers will create two identical leaves at once, making this step quick and efficient. Once you’ve completed the outline, cut down to the bottom point of the stem, then carefully open the paper to reveal your beautiful shamrock cutout. If necessary, you can make any additional adjustments to perfect the shape.\n\nStep 5: Add Decorative Elements\n\nNow that you have your shamrock cutout, it’s time to make it uniquely yours! You can embellish your shamrock with various decorative elements. If you gathered glitter, markers, or glue, consider using them to add color and texture to your design. For instance, you might opt to trace the edges of the shamrock with a marker for a bold outline or sprinkle glitter onto glued areas for a shimmering effect. Additionally, you could incorporate stickers or draw patterns on the leaves to enhance the festive feel. Be creative and have fun as you personalize your shamrock!\n\nStep 6: Display Your Shamrock\n\nWith your embellished shamrock complete, it’s time to showcase your handiwork! There are numerous ways to display your creation. You might hang it on a wall, attach it to a door, or even use it as a centerpiece for your St. Patrick’s Day table setting. To create a 3D effect, consider cutting out several shamrocks and layering them with different heights or using adhesive foam squares to give them some dimension. Alternatively, you can use string to create a garland by attaching the shamrocks along the length, making for a cheerful decoration. Whatever your choice, be sure to enjoy the charm it adds to your festive celebrations!\n\nStep 7: Share Your Creation\n\nOnce you’ve displayed your shamrock, don’t forget to share your crafting experience with friends and family! Whether through social media, a crafting group, or simply conversing, you can inspire others to join in the fun. Take photos of your unique shamrock cutouts and encourage others to create their own. Sharing tips ideas, and showcasing your creativity can turn this solitary craft into a community activity, inviting others to experience the joy of crafting and the spirit of St. Patrick’s Day. By fostering this connection, you celebrate your handiwork and spread the festive cheer!\n\nStep 8: Experiment with Different Sizes and Shapes\n\nNow that you’ve mastered the basic shamrock design, it’s time to get creative by experimenting with various sizes and shapes! Try using different folding techniques or drawing styles to create novelty shamrocks with unique characteristics. For instance, you can make tiny shamrocks for decorative confetti or large ones for bold wall art. Additionally, consider combining multiple shapes, like adding a pot of gold or incorporating other symbols of St. Patrick’s Day. The possibilities are endless, and this experimentation allows you to broaden your crafting skills while producing delightful variations of this classic cutout. Don’t hesitate to try new materials like patterned paper or fabric for more diverse textures and looks!\n\nStep 9: Incorporate Your Shamrock into Other Crafts\n\nNow that you’ve created and displayed your shamrock cutout consider incorporating it into other craft projects. You can use your shamrock as a decorative element in scrapbook pages, greeting cards, or a festive wreath. If you’re feeling adventurous, try creating a shamrock-themed mobile by stringing multiple cutouts together and suspending them from a hanger or branch. Additionally, you can use your shamrock as a stencil for painting or printing designs onto various surfaces. By integrating your shamrock into different crafts, you’ll expand its use and continue celebrating the spirit of St. Patrick’s Day in creative and fun ways!\n\nStep 10: Create a Shamrock-Themed Gift\n\nTo further embrace the spirit of St. Patrick’s Day, consider using your shamrock cutouts to create thoughtful gifts for friends and family. You can incorporate your designs into gift tags, wrapping paper, or handmade cards. For instance, attach a small shamrock cutout to a gift bag or bundle it with twine for an artistic touch. You might also fill a small box with treats and decorate it with shamrock paper or stickers. This personalization enhances the aesthetic of your gifts and conveys a heartfelt gesture to your loved ones. Get creative with the presentation, and let your shamrock cutouts add a festive flair to your gift-giving!\n\nFollowing these simple steps, you can create charming shamrock cutouts perfect for St. Patrick’s Day celebrations.\n\n5 Things You Should Avoid\n\nRushing the Cutting Process: Hurrying through the cutting stage can be tempting, but taking your time is essential for achieving smooth, clean edges. Rushing may lead to jagged cuts or uneven shapes that can detract from your final product. Using Dull Scissors: Always ensure your scissors are sharp for precise cuts. Dull scissors require more force and can hinder your ability to follow curves accurately, resulting in sloppy edges. Neglecting Safety Precautions: Cutting can be hazardous if safety precautions are not taken. Always cut away from your body and keep your fingers safely out of the cutting path. It’s wise to work on a stable surface to avoid accidents. Skipping the Fold: Don’t forget the critical technique of folding the paper to create identical leaves efficiently. Cutting a single layer limits your creation; folding the paper allows you to cut multiple leaves simultaneously. Ignoring the Design: Before you start cutting, be sure to plan and visualize your shamrock design. Failing to do so might lead to unexpected shapes that stray from your original idea, making it difficult to achieve the desired look.\n\nBy avoiding these five common mistakes, you can confidently produce stunning shamrock cutouts that will elevate your St.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, how to cut out a shamrock can be a delightful and rewarding craft that adds a festive touch to your St. Patrick’s Day celebrations.\n\nFollowing the steps outlined in this guide, from selecting suitable materials to showcasing and incorporating your designs, you can express your creativity while celebrating this joyful holiday. Remember to be patient and meticulous during the cutting process for the best results. Don’t hesitate to experiment with sizes, shapes, and other craft projects to make the most of your shamrock cutouts.\n\nUltimately, the joy of crafting lies in the final product and the enjoyment of the creative process itself. Happy crafting and may your shamrocks bring you luck and cheer!",

    "content": "How to Sew Wine Bottle Bags\n\nSewing wine bottle bags is a delightful and practical craft that not only serves as a stylish way to present a bottle of wine but also adds a personal touch to your gifting. Whether you’re celebrating a special occasion, attending a dinner party, or simply wanting to protect your bottle during transport, a handmade wine bottle bag can make your gift stand out. In this guide, we’ll explore the materials needed, step-by-step instructions on how to sew wine bottle bags, and tips to create beautiful, reusable wine bottle bags that are perfect for any wine enthusiast.\n\nWhy Sew Wine Bottle Bags?\n\nSewing wine bottle bags offers numerous advantages that go beyond just aesthetics. First and foremost, these bags provide a more sustainable option compared to traditional wrapping paper or disposable gift bags, encouraging eco-friendly gifting practices. Additionally, handmade wine bottle bags allow for customization in terms of fabric choice, colour, and design, enabling you to tailor each bag to the recipient’s personality or the theme of the event. Furthermore, creating wine bottle bags can be a fun and therapeutic project, providing an opportunity to express creativity and improve sewing skills. Ultimately, these bags add a personal touch to any gift, making the act of giving even more special.\n\nSimple and Fun DIY Project\n\nCreating your own wine bottle bags is not only straightforward but also a rewarding DIY project that can be completed in just a few hours. This craft requires minimal sewing skills, making it accessible for beginners while still allowing experienced sewists to enjoy the creative process. To get started, gather your materials, which will typically include fabric, thread, scissors, and a sewing machine. Choose vibrant patterns or rustic fabrics that complement the wine bottle you’ll be gifting. As you sew, feel free to experiment with different shapes, sizes, or embellishments like ribbons or tags to personalize each bag. This project also offers a wonderful opportunity to involve friends or family, turning it into a fun gathering where everyone can craft their unique wine bottle bags together.\n\n10 Methods How to Sew Wine Bottle Bags\n\n1: Basic Fabric Bag:\n\nA basic fabric wine bottle bag is a straightforward and versatile project. Start by selecting a sturdy fabric, such as cotton, canvas, or linen. Cut two rectangular pieces of fabric, each measuring approximately 16 inches by 18 inches. Place the fabric pieces right sides together and sew along the two longer sides and the bottom edge, leaving the top open. Turn the bag right side out and press the seams flat. To finish, fold the top edge down about 1 inch to create a hem and stitch it in place. Add a ribbon or twine to tie around the neck of the bottle for a simple yet elegant presentation. This method is easy to customize with different fabrics and embellishments.\n\n2 : Lined Wine Bag:\n\nA lined wine bag adds a polished and professional look to your project. Choose two coordinating fabrics: one for the outer bag and one for the lining. Cut two pieces of each fabric, each measuring 16 inches by 18 inches. Place the outer fabric pieces right sides together and sew along the sides and bottom. Repeat with the lining fabric, leaving a small opening at the bottom for turning. Insert the lining into the outer bag, right sides facing, and sew around the top edge. Turn the bag right side out through the opening in the lining, then stitch the opening closed. Push the lining into the outer bag and press the top edge. This method creates a sturdy, reversible bag that looks great inside and out.\n\n3: Drawstring Wine Bag:\n\nA drawstring wine bag is both functional and stylish. Begin by cutting two pieces of fabric, each 16 inches by 18 inches. Place the fabric pieces right sides together and sew along the sides and bottom, leaving the top open. To create the drawstring casing, fold the top edge down 2 inches and stitch around, leaving a small gap for threading the drawstring. Turn the bag right side out and press the seams. Thread a length of ribbon or cord through the casing using a safety pin. This method allows for easy closure and carrying, making it perfect for gifting.\n\n4: Patchwork Wine Bag:\n\nA patchwork wine bag is a fun and creative way to use fabric scraps. Cut several small squares or rectangles from different fabrics and arrange them in a pleasing pattern. Sew the pieces together to form two larger rectangles, each measuring 16 inches by 18 inches. Place the patchwork pieces right sides together and sew along the sides and bottom. Turn the bag right side out and press the seams. Finish the top edge with a hem or a drawstring casing. This method results in a unique, colorful bag that showcases your creativity and resourcefulness.\n\n5: Quilted Wine Bag:\n\nQuilting adds texture and insulation to a wine bag, making it both attractive and functional. Cut two pieces of fabric and two pieces of batting, each measuring 16 inches by 18 inches. Layer each fabric piece with a batting piece and quilt as desired, either by sewing straight lines, patterns, or free-motion quilting. Once quilted, place the fabric pieces right sides together and sew along the sides and bottom. Turn the bag right side out and finish the top edge with a hem or drawstring casing. This method adds a layer of protection for the wine bottle and creates a beautifully textured bag.\n\n6: Appliqué Wine Bag:\n\nAppliqué adds a decorative touch to a wine bag. Start by cutting two pieces of fabric, each 16 inches by 18 inches. Choose an appliqué design, such as a grape cluster, wine glass, or initial, and cut it from a contrasting fabric. Fuse the appliqué piece to one of the bag pieces using fusible webbing. Sew around the edges of the appliqué with a tight zigzag stitch to secure it. Place the bag pieces right sides together and sew along the sides and bottom. Turn the bag right side out and finish the top edge with a hem or drawstring casing. This method personalizes your wine bag and makes it extra special.\n\n7: Embroidered Wine Bag:\n\nEmbroidery adds an elegant and personal touch to a wine bag. Begin by cutting two pieces of fabric, each 16 inches by 18 inches. Using an embroidery hoop, embroider a design, monogram, or message on one of the fabric pieces. Once the embroidery is complete, place the fabric pieces right sides together and sew along the sides and bottom. Turn the bag right side out and finish the top edge with a hem or drawstring casing. This method allows you to create a truly personalized gift that reflects the recipient’s taste and your craftsmanship.\n\n8: Reversible Wine Bag:\n\nA reversible wine bag offers two looks in one. Choose two coordinating fabrics and cut two pieces of each, each measuring 16 inches by 18 inches. Place one outer fabric piece and one lining piece right sides together and sew along one short edge. Repeat with the other two pieces. Open the sewn pieces and place them right sides together, matching the seams. Sew around the sides and bottom, leaving a small opening in the lining for turning. Turn the bag right side out and stitch the opening closed. Push the lining into the outer bag and press the top edge. This method provides a versatile bag that can be used for different occasions by simply reversing it.\n\n9: Personalized Vinyl-Cut Wine Bag:\n\nPersonalize a wine bag with vinyl cut designs using a cutting machine like a Cricut. Cut two pieces of fabric, each 16 inches by 18 inches. Design and cut a vinyl decal with the recipient’s name, a monogram, or a decorative element using your cutting machine. Apply the vinyl decal to one of the fabric pieces according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Place the fabric pieces right sides together and sew along the sides and bottom. Turn the bag right side out and finish the top edge with a hem or drawstring casing. This method combines the precision of a cutting machine with the handmade charm of a sewn bag.\n\n10: Burlap Wine Bag with Ribbon:\n\nBurlap adds a rustic and natural look to a wine bag. Cut two pieces of burlap, each 16 inches by 18 inches. To prevent fraying, hem the edges of the burlap pieces by folding them over twice and stitching them down. Place the burlap pieces right sides together and sew along the sides and bottom. Turn the bag right side out and press the seams. Finish the top edge with a hem or drawstring casing. Add a decorative ribbon around the neck of the bottle for a finishing touch. This method results in a charming, rustic bag that is perfect for gifting to wine lovers.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, there are many ways to make a beautiful and functional wine bag at home. From simple sewn patterns to more intricate techniques such as quilting, appliqué, and embroidery, the possibilities are endless. With some basic sewing skills and a little creativity, you can create personalized wine bags that make perfect gifts or add a unique touch to your own gatherings.
